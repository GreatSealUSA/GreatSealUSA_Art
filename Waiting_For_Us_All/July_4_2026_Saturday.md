Can you dig it? I've been waiting such a long time for Saturday July 4, 20**26** When We The People Pluribus (lyrics: "A man playing guitar and singing for *Us All*... (Free) Will you help him change the world?) Wake from our Great Seal USA avoidance slumber!   

* New Years cheers and a toast to *the California Girl* this Saturday on GitHub ... "he was an American-born citizen, the only child of Italian immigrants who came to the U.S. before he was born, and he grew up in Hoboken, New Jersey, a short distance from NYC, with a deep connection to the area, though he had residences in New York. His parents arrived from Sicily and Genoa, Italy, in the 1890s/early 1900s, seeking a better life, making Sinatra a first-generation American and a product of the immigrant experience he often sang about."

*  Hey, gumbaree, e se la dee. “Hey, mister, and if the goddesses.”

Eh cumpari, ici nari.
