# "the most miserable person on Earth"


23 minutes into episode one.

Helen says she tried to read Finnegans Wake in graduate school. Helen then tells Carol: if you make just *one person happy* 

1. Helen: "It's probably great. I don't know."

2. Helen: "All I know is it made me *miserable* trying to get through it."

3. Helen: "I figure... if you make even *one person* happy, maybe that's not art."

&nbsp;

The tagline for the show is **"the most miserable person on Earth"**... 

Is the entire hive mind trying to make one person, *Carol*, happy? Or is Carol trying to make one person, Helen, happy?

All the marketing for the show is petri dish *smile faces*, trying to not make just one person happy, but every sigle person happy.
