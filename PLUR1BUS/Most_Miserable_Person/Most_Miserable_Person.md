# "the most miserable person on Earth"


23 minutes into episode one.

Helen says she tried to read Finnegans Wake in graduate school. Helen then tells Carol: if you make just *one person happy* 

1. Helen: "It's probably great"

2. Helen: "It made me *miserable* trying to get through it"

3. Helen: "I figure... if you make even *one person* happy, maybe that is not art"

&nbsp;

The tagline for the show is **"the most miserable person on Earth"**... 

Is the entire hive mind trying to make one person, *Carol*, happy? Or is Carol trying to make one person, Helen, happy?
