First 10 minutes:

1. Cemistry is described as the cycle of building up and breaking down, that this is how life works. A simpler pattern thatn the Finn Cycle of 4.

2. At 10 minutes into show: Educators are mocked. The students at the car wash, the wealthy Showbiz Kids making movies of themselves, don't give a fuck about anybody else. Age 50 Teacher Walter White feels economically humiliated for having to labor / job / work.

3. Parents have raised a generaton to mock science teaching as Carl Sagan's 1995 book outlines. Dumb and Dumber quote. Smartphone recording Teacher Walter White washing the wheels, licking the boots on feet of a car.

4. Parents themselves mock teachers / adults teach their children that gradeschool teachers are unimportant in Untied States of America.

Music industry cartel not backing up the film video in the vault degrated to YouTube - soon A.I. will disappear those media ecology realities with fake-inserted "corrections" that are not true reality to film original.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BznKC3Umc8A
