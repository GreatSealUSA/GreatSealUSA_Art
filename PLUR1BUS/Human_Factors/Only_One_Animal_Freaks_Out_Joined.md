# Only One Animal Freaks Out Joined

Season One asserted multiple episodes that animals are wild. Even domestic dogs are free to leave their owners.

What the fandom seems to not recognize is that the hive mind has never "crashed" or "freaked out" like it does with Carol... to any animal encounter.

Human beings evolved on Earth to climb trees and stay in caves, and build fires, and other defenses.

A snake doesn't scare people any more? You could argue that every person has the talent of a shake charmer...

But couldn't you also argue that every person now has military training to be fearless in the face of a human attacking?

Have Carol's aggressive emotions really been that strong compared to how animals charge at or attack humans.

Nobody in the hive mind joined is afraid of bear attacks or angry bulls attacking people? As Carol would get her home phone ringing if an instinctive reaction happened.

No, something odd is going on with this story. Some crafted only reactions to wild emotions of a human person. Episode 9 shows it isn't only Carol who can do this, so intimate Pirate Lady feelings aren't the requirement.
