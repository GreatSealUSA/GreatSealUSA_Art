# Alien Abduction 

Somewhat joking, but who knows, the Pluribus show comes from Twilight Zone family inspiration ;)

Fish being alien abducted out of their envionrment into Earth airspace, measured, probed, returned to place of capture. After having been abducted (relocated) from rivers and delivered to Arizona in year 1911 (? exact date earlier in video).

## Marshall McLuhan

“One thing about which fish know exactly nothing is water, since they have no anti-environment which would enable them to perceive the element they live in.”
― Marshall McLuhan, War and Peace in the Global Village, University of Toronto, Media Studies, year 1968, page 175

I actually suspect fish do know something about non-water, but the metaphor of self-awareness is still valid.

One of the most important and overlooked media ecology books ever published.
