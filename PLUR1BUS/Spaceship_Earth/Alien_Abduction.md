## Marshall McLuhan

“One thing about which fish know exactly nothing is water, since they have no anti-environment which would enable them to perceive the element they live in.”
― Marshall McLuhan, War and Peace in the Global Village, University of Toronto, Media Studies, year 1968, page 175

I actually suspect fish do know something about non-water, but the metaphor of self-awareness is still valid.

One of the most important and overlooked media ecology books ever published.
