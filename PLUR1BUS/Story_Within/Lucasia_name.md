# Lucasia name

" "Lucasia" was the poetic pseudonym for Anne Owen, a close friend of the 17th-century poet Katherine Philips. Philips wrote many poems to Lucasia, and their close friendship was a significant theme in her work, often compared to powerful male friendships described in literature of the time. Lucasia's name was derived from the Latin word for "light-giving" ("Lucas") and was part of a system of pseudonyms used by members of the correspondence group The Society of Friendship, which Philips founded."
