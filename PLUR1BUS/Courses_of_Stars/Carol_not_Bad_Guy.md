# Carol not Bad Guy

The show creators have emphasized out of band that Carol is not a bad guy like Walter White.

So end of Episode Three perspective. Carol murder-suicide "accident" impulse / biological directive. https://youtu.be/Gf2dDtqtqvc?t=169

Maybe Carol will teach this technique to the hive mind. Relevant to another planet that has lost something, and a similar tactic will be deployed against The Empire type evil rulers / dark side rulers.
