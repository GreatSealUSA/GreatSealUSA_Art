# The BINGO Rat

As of the first episode, episode one.

I still have a line of interpretation that humans weaponized the virus in the lab. The bar television emphasized military base lockdown.

The RNA sequence, the 78 second message, is pretty damn short.

Maybe it was only a key, and the military lab / rulers of the world were combining it with other things. And this one rat was the BINGO winner (Better Call Saul rat).

At first they showed the petri dishes and oral contact spread. But then (once the hive was deeded by the rat and the two at the vending machine) the hive group weaponied it further to air drop / chemtrails on Finnegans Wake release Public House day.
