# The BINGO Rat

As of the first episode, episode one.

I still have a line of interpretation that humans weaponized the virus in the lab. The bar television emphasized military base lock-down.

The RNA sequence, the 78 second message, is pretty damn short.

Maybe the outer-space RNA was only an essential key to inject changes (like a [software install app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installer.app), not the actual payload app, but the installer program), and the military lab / rulers of the world were combining that RNA "skeleton key" to with other things (payloads). And this one rat was the BINGO winner (Better Call Saul rat). So **each (nearly identical) rat was being given a different virus** to seek out specific behavior changes. BINGO rat had the brain reboot / played dead (Tim Finnegan).

1. Early on... humans discover that the RNA 78-second message is only an install app. Like a "hello world" app of how to modify animals (including humans). But nobody has yet injected it into a human, only animal testing.
   
2. First only rats were being given direct injections, each rat in isolation. Each rat given a different virus / mRNA injection. (A [printer cranking out new variations](https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2023/05/02/vaccine-printer-could-help-vaccines-reach-more-people/) for each test run)

3. BINGO rat

4. Human to human Spreading via kissing at the vending machine / STD / Herpes oral. Creating the first peer to peer hivemind.

5. Human to human... Donut spread oral / like hepatitis and herpes spread via food

6. Hive group was boxing it up for export via Petri dishes.

7. The hive group weaponized it further to air drop / chemtrails on Finnegans Wake release Public House day.
