# The BINGO Rat

As of the first episode, episode one.

I still have a line of interpretation that humans weaponized the virus in the lab. The bar television emphasized military base lockdown.

The RNA sequence, the 78 second message, is pretty damn short.

Maybe it was only a key, and the military lab / rulers of the world were combining it with other things. And this one rat was the BINGO winner (Better Call Saul rat). So **each (nearly identical) rat was being given a different virus** to seek out specific behavior changes. BIGO rat had the brain reboot / played dead (Tim Finnegan).

&nbsp;

1. First only rats were being given direct injections, each rat in isolation

2. BINGO rat

3. Human to human Spreading via kissing at the vending machine / STD / Herpes oral. Creating the first peer to peer hivemind.

4. Humab to human... Donut spread oral / like hepatitus and herpies spread via food

5. Hive group was boxing it up for export via petri dishes.

6. The hive group weaponized it further to air drop / chemtrails on Finnegans Wake release Public House day.
