# Artificial Intelligence Early

This video makes the case that the fragility is evidence of it being artificial intelligence. Early theory based on only first 2 episodes.

So this makes the story that real world Elon Musk kind of AI patches humanity with a RNA.

"After the second episode, I feel this story is one big metaphor for AI.  Gilligan (the head writer) is notoriously against AI and hates it and this is his little sci fi spin on it.  The "survivors" dont act like regular people would.  It is a metaphor for the sheep just going a long with AI or only see suing it for their own ends or in denial.  These people "know" that their loved ones are not people anymore, but are in denial.  The one guy is basically treating these new pod people like slaves.  And the pod people with their "new code" in them with no ability to refuse or cause paid just goes along with it. They just shrug off 800 MILLION people dying like ho hum, that's the cost! It is basically the AI proponents now who shrug off the warnings "welp we may all die or be put out of work forever!" with no thought of the downside.

I think whether this people like this will be 100% dependent on this whole story be a big metaphor rather than a realistic sci fi drama.  As I said elsewhere, this is more like an extended Twilight Zone type story with a point."

Personally I don't agree with that comment

1. People shrugged off COVID-19 the first 6 months in USA, when we DID NOT YET KNOW it was not very deadly. It could have been far more deadly, but people were not given the choice - it was spread agressively by people who put put freedom above all else. People who wouldn't even wear a mask and used their freedom to invent wild anti-mask ideas (like you can't breath).

2. USA population has shrugged off health care cost crisis for decades. Housing price crisis since yar 2004. Only thing people seem to get upset about is gasoline prices in USA over the decades. Rising health care cost of $200 a month pepole ignore in favor of $50 a month savings ingasolute. It isn't rational. 

3. Earth does not ask for conssent when smashing rocks into Earth, when earthquakes happen, when land-mine virus are sitting there ready to be triggered. Major disease outbreaks are human history! These are not hypothetical, that's what shaped humanity, it's the very building blocks of our planet Earth. Carol does not view this as nature, she is viewing it like a government - as she flies around without need for passport and visa or even money.

4. I do agree that it is more metaphor than trying to create a realistic model. There is magical technology.

My biggest thing is we don't know enough. Are there other flaws in the hive mind, such as no longer allowing births or killing off people. Previews show Carol in an empty grocery store. Do people still eat food for pleasure, or only vegitarian to staisfy the nutrional needs?
