# The Grand Hoax

Epsiode 1 and 2 have brewed.

Hoax One

The alien signal was faked. That is where Carl Sagan's *Contact* film ended, with a Hoax theory. Fake the signal from far enough away. There is no life discovered on another planet, there is no RNA compatibility between Kepler-22b.

Hoax Two

It isn't accidental that 12 people are in a contest of leadership / who commands the hive mind. The hoax being that it is accidental / unintentional that 12 would be left outside the mind to provide contrast.

* “One thing about which fish know exactly nothing is water, since they have no anti-environment which would enable them to perceive the element they live in.”
― Marshall McLuhan, War and Peace in the Global Village, 1968, nonfiction

The god-like power to easily crash the hive mind network that the 12 free minds have. The symbolism of 13 in the show title, Great Seal of the United states of America pyramid. The Awakening of the Finnegans.
