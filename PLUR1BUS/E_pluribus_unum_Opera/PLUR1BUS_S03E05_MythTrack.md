If you think logically, but is the Pluribus Great Seal of the USA about Logic thinking? Out-group polarity.

Something the hive man can do to make you *smile again*?

Soul vacation, Helen? Finnegan ALP, alive or dead?

### New Mexico Convoy Hive Mind

Caral creates nicknames for her characters in her pirate stories. Land Pirate metaphors abound, landlocked New Mexico (Old Mexico isn't land lock, oceans on sides). 

**New mexico***

1. "Bear" is police, Carol's policing milk lost and found and police car. "Bear" is also a homosexual term? In a hive-mind cock-blocked two spouses relationship? Pussy-blocked animal terms?

2. Fleeing in a convoy from Carol in police car.

3. Military outpost / Fort metaphors of standing on top of a high building. { Watchtower (Watch Out! Echoland! Caution!, Jimi Hendrix on ICE / state police / bears chasing ), guard tower, obeservation tower, vantage point }

Empty school visuals opening, empty city Carol.

Keppler-22b puts on a show for Carol.

ToDo: was the Keppler-22b signal in daytime New Mexico array hours or night-time. Even if the sun is out, daytime, stars are still in the sky... Pirate Lady gender changs abound, night and day, trans-gender transitions.
