## Track: Audiences watching Happy Days / Saul

Bad guys admiration audiences who won't sustain focus and repeating and repeating Washington "The Capital" - about RFK Jr and the kind of pro-cancer nonsense that Walter White praises pro-poison of the mind drug dealiing blue meth metaphors.

Scientists in love with lawyers, military base killers in love. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtIobGdKR5U

1. Alien invasion

2. Anti-openess, red tape, legal jargon to keep Pluribus "We The People" at each other's throats like Walter White and Lawyer Saul bad-man

3. Walter White scientists in love with military secret lab scientists. Power of knowledge and technique over others to cause harm via harmful toxic substances that make people even more aggressive and cut-throat (blue meth). Blue not being relaxing, but hyper-greed and anti-life drug.

This is a Deism / Humanist song, Founding Fathers values of USA. 

* "**These men did not believe in a Fall**. They did not think the mind of man was cut off from God. The mind of man, cleansed of secondary and merely temporal concerns, beholds with the radiance of a cleansed mirror a reflection of the rational mind of God. Reason puts you in touch with God. Consequently, for these men, there is no special revelation anywhere, and none is needed, because the mind of man cleared of its fallibilities is sufficiently capable of the knowledge of God. All people in the world are thus capable because **all people in the world are capable** of reason. All men are capable of reason. That is the fundamental principle of democracy. Because everybody's mind is capable of true knowledge, you don't have to have a **special authority, or a special revelation telling you** that this is the way things should be." - Skywalker Ranch lessons for science fiction audiences, "Power of Myth", 1988

# TRACK Freedom: Orinoco *Flow*

Pirate Lady Author, Pirate Lady Character, Riding the Ocean Waves....

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTrk4X9ACtw

"Orinoco Flow", also released as "Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)", is a song by Irish singer-songwriter Enya from her second studio album, Watermark (1988)

* 1988... Same year as Power of Myth, filmed by George Lucas for science fiction fandoms. Power of Myth covers: the legendary Irish pirate queen Grace O'Malley (Gráinne Ní Mháille), who appears in Book I, Chapter 1, often referenced playfully as "her grace o'malice" or the "prankquean", embodying powerful, cunning womanhood and Irish defiance. Finnegans Wake was published on Star Wars Day 1939. May 4.

* “I love everything that flows,” said the great blind Milton of our times. I was thinking of him this morning when I awoke with a great bloody shout of joy: I was thinking of his rivers and trees and all that world of night which he is exploring. Yes, I said to myself, I too love everything that flows: rivers, sewers, lava, semen, blood, bile, words, sentences. I love the amniotic fluid when it spills out of the bag. I love the kidney with its painful gallstones, its gravel and what-not; I love the urine that pours out scalding and the clap that runs endlessly; I love the words of hysterics and the sentences that flow on like dysentery and mirror all the sick images of the soul; I love the great rivers like the Amazon and the Orinoco, where crazy men like Moravagine float on through dream and legend in an open boat and drown in the blind mouths of the river. I love everything that flows, even the menstrual flow that carries away the seed unfecund. I love scripts that flow, be they hieratic, esoteric, perverse, polymorph, or unilateral. I love everything that flows, everything that has time in it and becoming, that brings us back to the beginning where there is never end: the violence of the prophets, the obscenity that is ecstasy, the wisdom of the fanatic, the priest with his rubber litany, the foul words of the whore, the spittle that floats away in the gutter, the milk of the breast and the bitter honey that pours from the womb, all that is fluid, melting, dissolute and dissolvent, all the pus and dirt that in flowing is purified, that loses its sense of origin, that makes the great circuit toward death and dissolution. The great incestuous wish is to flow on, one with time, to merge the great image of the beyond with the here and now. A fatuous, suicidal wish that is constipated by words and paralyzed by thought.” ― Henry Miller, Tropic of Cancer. Famously banned in the U.S. for obscenity

CAMPBELL: And do you know who that god is? It’s you. All of these symbols in mythology refer to you. **You can get stuck** out there, and think it’s all out there. So you’re thinking about Jesus with all the sentiments relevant to how he suffered — out there. But that suffering is what ought to be going on in you. Have you been spiritually reborn? Have you died to your animal nature and come to life as a human incarnation of compassion?" - [1988 book, "Power of Myth", Page 219](https://books.google.com/books?id=cM5vDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&dq=%22So+you%E2%80%99re+thinking+about+Jesus+with+all+the+sentiments+relevant+to+how+he+suffered%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

His name, meaning "invincible" or "all-conquering," reflects his spiritual victory over paganism, and devotion grew significantly in England after his relics arrived, leading to churches and landmarks, like London's St Pancras Station"
