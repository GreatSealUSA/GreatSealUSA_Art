## Track: Audiences watching Happy Days / Saul

Bad guys admiration audiences who won't sustain focus and repeating and repeating Washington "The Capital" - about RFK Jr and the kind of pro-cancer nonsense that Walter White praises pro-poison of the mind drug dealiing blue meth metaphors.

Scientists in love with lawyers, military base killers in love. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtIobGdKR5U

1. Alien invasion

2. Anti-openess, red tape, legal jargon to keep Pluribus "We The People" at each other's throats like Walter White and Lawyer Saul bad-man

3. Walter White scientists in love with military secret lab scientists. Power of knowledge and technique over others to cause harm via harmful toxic substances that make people even more aggressive and cut-throat (blue meth). Blue not being relaxing, but hyper-greed and anti-life drug.

# Fog of Pandemic

Fog of war metaphors, fog of pandemic we all experienced December 2019 onward with COVID-19 information. Uncertainty. Can a cure be developed for COVID-19? That's what Carol is living under.

# Helen was the Kingpin publisher

Helen's post-doctorate ++ thesis at Minute 22 over Walter White's Gravesite. 

https://youtu.be/0ulxDCNaKxk?list=PLfGibfZATlGq3vBSxcoTQGwlU7GO31m3L&t=65

When was Helen born? 1965? 

There was nothing that I could do, so I pointed my car... 

"I was singing this song when Helen came alive" / Tim / Helen's Fall at the Public House.

It was 48 hours until Helen came around... Bring back the Boston book publishing printing. You gotta Bring Helen on home.

Helen is the kingpin inside the hive mind to knock down / knock out (EMP / New Mexico Manhattan Steely Dandom Atomic Projects). The king piece of chess inside the hive mind that has built the fandom and bitter implosion trigger metaephors abound.

The real battle just begun (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)    
To claim the victory Jesus won (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)

# Pyramid Step-down: Low Places

1997 / 1998 date is significant to backdate events / countup countdown onnscreen    

Carol and Helen are not big on social graces, drunkard at the Oasis at the Zero Hour with her Pirate Lady fandom. Slumming book tour with fandom.

Outside the step "Ivory Tower" higher https://youtu.be/qT_uonWYRrQ?t=120 (Tim high paces on ladder, fall to friends in public house) - Helen intimate friend gave her the post-doctorate thesis of a life time at the Zero Hour - Finn's Hotel year 1923. Joyce isn't big on social graces. Friends in low places. Boozing author Carol can go boozing with author James Joyce the drunkard and his buddies at Finn's Hotel for low-blows to the hive mind: https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/504662-my-sweet-little-whorish-nora-i-did-as-you-told Literary.

Carol's post book tour fandom dirty feeling. Social graces of her fandom / audience contempt she holds.

Another verse from 1997 / 1998 in Ireland!

* "a massive, record-breaking event featuring five sold-out shows at Croke Park in Dublin, drawing over 400,000 fans and showcasing a spectacular stage, culminating in the famous Garth Brooks: Ireland and Back TV special on NBC"

* Where: Croke Park, Dublin, Ireland. ("A moment from the 1921 Leinster Hurling Final at Croke Park. As Dublin secured victory over Kilkenny (4-4 to 1-5), Harry Boland smiles") https://joycegeek.com/2015/03/26/cartography/

*  The largest stage ever built in Ireland at the time, featuring record-breaking crowds for the Garth Brooks World Tour.

*  Wake wave of the media event. "the overwhelming demand led to future tour cancellations in 2014"

*  "The TV special titled Garth Brooks: Ireland and Back originally aired in the United States on March 4, 1998, on NBC" (lag time / post-production media ecology / supply chain / import delays / shipping metaphors)
