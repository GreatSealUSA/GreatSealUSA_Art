Breakfast in America....

Take a look at my "Pirate Lady", not much of a Helen girlfriend...

(Return after, inverted return trip) Take a gamble across the ocean to meet 5 English speakers....

The outsider man believes in Vegas, everyone is a millionare in USA.

Carol is playing her jokes upon the Hive Mind, against Helen, while there is nothing better to do!

Carol to Hive Mind: "Don't you understand, I've told you before! Just get off my case, This isn't Happening. Stop this now!"

The Hive Mind is riding the Finnegans Wake Waves / Media Ecology Waves / of the 13 free thinking surfing the Hive Mind World / Earth / Pale Blue Dot.

**"Is This It!?"**

Hello, **We** are back after you crashed our minds with your emotional ourbursts - the Hive Mind is taking Calls, Carol!

### Track 3: So can you tell?

Hive mind, can you tell?   
Carol, can yuou tell smile from a "Pirate Lady" as Helen?   
Did they get you to trade Helen for ghosts?    
Carol is your house a lead role in a cage? Are you performing for the Hive Mind, in your leading role?   
What did you find in your 4.5 unpublished book that wasn't already waiting to be found in Finnegans Wake? The *same old* nightmare fears of Humanity.

Countdown ;)

Countdown to Ecstasy. Can you hear Carol on her old telephone?

No Sprouts in the Promised World growing, the shelf is empty.

Driving in my car throught the *Finnegans ruins* of New Mexico.
