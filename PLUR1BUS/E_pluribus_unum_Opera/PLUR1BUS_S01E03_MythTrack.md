### Track 1: Pepper bacon for breakfast?

Breakfast in America.... 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQdoUUi3iJ8

Take a look at my "Pirate Lady", not much of a Helen girlfriend...

(Return after, inverted return trip) Take a gamble across the ocean to meet 5 English speakers....

The outsider man believes in Vegas, everyone is a millionare in USA.

Carol is playing her jokes upon the Hive Mind, against Helen, while there is nothing better to do!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oet5L-gqctk   

Carol to Hive Mind: "Don't you understand, I've told you before! Just get off my case, This isn't Happening. Stop this now!"

The Hive Mind is riding the Finnegans Wake Waves / Media Ecology Waves / of the 13 free thinking surfing the Hive Mind World / Earth / Pale Blue Dot.

**"Is This It!?"**

Hello, **We** are back after you crashed our minds with your emotional ourbursts - the Hive Mind is taking Calls, Carol!

&nbsp;

### Track 3: So can you tell?

Hive mind, can you tell?   
Carol, can yuou tell smile from a "Pirate Lady" as Helen?   
Did they get you to trade Helen for ghosts?    
Carol is your house a lead role in a cage? Are you performing for the Hive Mind, in your leading role?   
What did you find in your 4.5 unpublished book that wasn't already waiting to be found in Finnegans Wake? The *same old* nightmare fears of Humanity.

### Track 4: Hello World from Sprouts

Countdown ;)

Countdown to Ecstasy. Can you hear Carol on her old telephone?

No Sprouts in the Promised World growing, the shelf is empty.

Driving in my car throught the *Finnegans ruins* of New Mexico.

To Helen: I'm on a Journey - Carol

&nbsp;

### Track 6: Recognize the pain I'm in

Carol's unpublished book **Bitter ...**

https://youtu.be/1lyu1KKwC74?t=25

Carol is taking the hive mind down the *one bitter road she has known*....

There is nobody singing to Carol now...

&nbsp;

### Track 7: Turn it DOWN, Carol!

TURN IT DOWN, CAROL, YOU CRASH THE HIVE MIND!

Carol telling the Hive Mind, open Sprouts, Walk This Way...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B_UYYPb-Gk

Carol is teaching the baby hive mind, how to be a maverick. 

Carol is adding bitter spices to the hive mind gumbo, a woman telling her fiction Pirate Lady to be like a pirate!

&nbsp;

# Track 8: Carol's house on the Frontier 

Sprouts store, airport, but her house is up at the end of the frountier / undeveloped land.

There are ways we have to free the mind. Walter White, Suburb, Carol, Suburb. Subdivisions. SubReddits.

&nbsp;

# Track 9: Brick themes

1. Carol and much of the audience thinks the hive mind can't get satire. Like the song "Thick as a brick" part 1 and part 2 song.

2. Ben Folds Five... she's a brick. Drowning the hive mind.

The grenade thorugh window, brick / glass houses.

Carol, author and writer... wife of Helen publisher... Sleeping with the Golden Girls on. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7lpvVf2rCY - late night boozing companion and gun foreplay.

ToDo: list some specific emphasisis / quotes   

&nbsp;

# Track 11: Loaded Checkov's Gun

A toy? Point a toy gun / prop gun at an African immigrant... what satire / sarcasm / Pretzel Logic is this. Maybe the audience of the show isn't getting the satire. First rule of gun training is always asume a gun is a loaded gun and do not point it at your house visitor.

Whose face was it that we saw? Was it you running from the Spouts store? Or another member of the hive mind.

Carol put this Africa woman down, punched her into unconsious twice now. Once in front of her house, second time in Spain at the outdoor meal. Now Carol asks for a gun, invites the African invader into her house and puts the loaded gun on the table during a "discussion". Payback, time to pay the other with a gun for taking Helen.

&nbsp;

# Track 12: Liquid Courage

Carol starts boozing up until she goes insane and then claims playing with weapon toys, poiniting a gun at the African immigrant... she is well practiced at this booze mindset.

The woman Carol is terrified by... she invites at her house, and puts the loaded gun on the table during the intimidation "God Father" ruler meet me in my home office, meeting. Making the African immigrant bring the weapon for the kill with her, she's your bitch...
