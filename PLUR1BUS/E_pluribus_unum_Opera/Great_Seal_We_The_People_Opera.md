I am frustrated white male sick of the white male ELon Musk science teacher role models. No Carl Sagan's abound for white men. And so many white men are rejecting Neil D. T. (I don't, and his Cosmos remaake encouraged).

Yes, this is about race to me, because I grew up in white suprmacy attitudes of 1970's and 1980's that were anti-Woodstock anti-hippies but lust for Detrout auto machines, love for machines, and the love people had for computer machines. I was insocial media with machines, looking for outer-space signals like Sagan's contact. Radio set like at the opeing of Contact, that social media. KBRV0896 call-sign. Computers I was invovled in in-person public library users groups. Webelos, cup scouts, boy scouts, social in-person group. And especially my church: { dramaa, choir, overnight slumber parties (co-ed sleepvers) } at downtown central church and met people outside my school. My church had a woman priest.

I did not play video games much. I studied then, played a few, but I didn't have a video game console - I had a personal computer (Commodore 64) and authored social media software based on my social media radio expierence. Learning, reading books, public library, the explosion of magazines from desktop publishing dominated me at age 11 year 1980 onward. Non-fiction learning from non-fiction magazones and academic books /reference manuals from Commodore, DEC, IBM, programming language study.

1988 is the year I graduated high school. Just weeks after graduation, Power of Myth from Chicago PBS station. Age 18 graduation to the Great Seal USA book learning from the 1988 power of myth book at the public library. Franklin public library ideals.

At SAP, R/3 app generations, Unix based... I was early on TCP/IP before Microosft had a Windows for WOrkgroups 3.1 naative stack because of SAP customers training cnterter and TCP/IP client/server apps. Was reading Usenet and the academic Internet right before it became the "Commercial Internet" and AOL "Eternal september" social media usenet and mailing lists.

Power of Myth 1988 book:

* Spiritually, however, the center is where sight is. Stand on a height and view the horizon. Stand on the moon and view the whole earth rising — even, **by way of television, in your parlor**.” The result is an **unprecedented expansion of horizon,** one that could well serve in our age, as the ancient mythologies did in theirs, to cleanse the doors of perception “to the wonder, at once terrible and fascinating, of ourselves and of the universe.” He argued that it is not science that has diminished human beings or divorced us from divinity. On the contrary, the **new discoveries of science “rejoin us to the ancients” by enabling us to recognize in this whole universe** “a reflection magnified of our own most inward nature; so that we are indeed its ears, its eyes, its thinking, and its speech — or, in theological terms, God’s ears, God’s eyes, God’s thinking, and God’s **Word**.” The last time I saw him I asked him if he still believed—as he once had written — “that we are at **this moment** participating in one of the very greatest leaps of the **human spirit to a knowledge** not only of outside nature but also of our own deep inward mystery.” ... He thought a minute and answered, “The **greatest ever**.” - after death of Campbell October 1987, published 1988

Greatest ever, Great Seal USA, "by way of television, in your parlor" - media ecology.  And indeed, after my high school graduation... summer of year 1988. June 21 to June 26, 1988. And the public library to get the book.

It is sad to me in December 2025 that that 20 hours of video and the book are not public domain, free of copyright. Everything JCF should be public domain after this October 1987 death. It is humanity, some of the best of New York City and Hawaii and all his traveles to Muich and Paris for university. A Wiki of wourld mythology with video and text - public domain for all humanity.

Earth, humanity, created Eden and John One One. Just as teams of writers and researches created Pluribus. Just as James Joyce created Finn's Hotel 1923, Finnegans Wake "May the Force Be With You" May 4, 1939
