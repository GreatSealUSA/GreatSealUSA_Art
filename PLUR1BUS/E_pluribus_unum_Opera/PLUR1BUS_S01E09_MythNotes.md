* 1988 Skywalker Ranch lessons for Science Fiction film and television audiences.

    * BILL MOYERS: And what do they say to you about women?

    * JOSEPH CAMPBELL: They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The **out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy.
Now, today there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity**. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.” Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and **our own Western subjugation of the female** is a function of biblical thinking.

The expectations of what this was about, Carol's eggs and surrogate motherhood. The Christmas eve rituals of childbirth.

"We would never hurt you" to the young woman with the pregnancy gift in a stainless steel canister. 

Throughout human history, tens of thousands of years and longer, pregnancy has been an extreme health risk to women. A pregnant woman is slowed down / pained / vulnerable. She needs special foods  / nutrition. She can bleed out or have a dead fetus inside her body. Coffin birth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin_birth

Maternal Sepsis: A life-threatening condition where the body’s extreme response to a pregnancy-related infection causes organ failure and potentially death.

Life on Earth has not been pain-free and honest sincere about the real risk when there wasn't 911 telephone serve, air lift to hospital, and library full of books on medical knowledge.

She asks "Will it hurt" to the elders, childbirth if rarely painless for any human anywhere in history. "No, Kusimayu, not one bit!"

* Young woman whose name means "River of Joy" in Quechua, is one of the few individuals who have not been absorbed into a global hivemind - one of the free-thinking 13 is manipulated by the { advertising, marketing, selling commutations and manipulation methods } of those in power in the world.

~~Further, they have manipulated this young woman to go against the desires and wishes of another free individual, Carol. Turning a free person into an agent of abuse of another free person.~~

&nbsp;

The tear-down of the ritual, the ceremony is over. The power of human rituals to overcome fear.

* "Then the little couple is pulled out and roasted and eaten that very evening. The ritual is the repetition of the original act of the killing of a god followed by the coming of food from the dead savior. In the sacrifice of the Mass, you are taught that this is the body and blood of the Savior. You take it to you, and you turn inward, and there he works within you."

# 12:00 end of season

Start of the season: Carol is rushing around on Air Force One and sending out videos to the 13 begging people to resist the hive invasion.

End of the season: now she acts like business as usual. Why would any free person want to meet and discuss resisting the alien invasion? 

60 days has changed Carol from day 6.
