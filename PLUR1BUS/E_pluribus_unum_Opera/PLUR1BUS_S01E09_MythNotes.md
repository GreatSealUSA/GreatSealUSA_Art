* 1988 Skywalker Ranch lessons for Science Fiction film and television audiences.

    * BILL MOYERS: And what do they say to you about women?

    * JOSEPH CAMPBELL: They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The **out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy.
Now, today there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity**. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.” Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and **our own Western subjugation of the female** is a function of biblical thinking.

The expectations of what this was about, Carol's eggs and surrogate motherhood. The Christmas eve rituals of childbirth.

"We would never hurt you" to the young woman with the pregnancy gift in a stainless steel canister. 

Throughout human history, tens of thousands of years and longer, pregnancy has been an extreme health risk to women. A pregnant woman is slowed down / pained / vulnerable. She needs special foods  / nutrition. She can bleed out or have a dead fetus inside her body. Coffin birth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin_birth

Maternal Sepsis: A life-threatening condition where the body’s extreme response to a pregnancy-related infection causes organ failure and potentially death.

Life on Earth has not been pain-free and honest sincere about the real risk when there wasn't 911 telephone serve, air lift to hospital, and library full of books on medical knowledge.

She asks "Will it hurt" to the elders, childbirth if rarely painless for any human anywhere in history. "No, Kusimayu, not one bit!"

* Young woman whose name means "River of Joy" in Quechua, is one of the few individuals who have not been absorbed into a global hivemind - one of the free-thinking 13 is manipulated by the { advertising, marketing, selling commutations and manipulation methods } of those in power in the world.

~~Further, they have manipulated this young woman to go against the desires and wishes of another free individual, Carol. Turning a free person into an agent of abuse of another free person.~~

&nbsp;

The tear-down of the ritual, the ceremony is over. The power of human rituals to overcome fear.

* "Then the little couple is pulled out and roasted and eaten that very evening. The ritual is the repetition of the original act of the killing of a god followed by the coming of food from the dead savior. In the sacrifice of the Mass, you are taught that this is the body and blood of the Savior. You take it to you, and you turn inward, and there he works within you."

&nbsp;

# 12:00 end of season

Start of the season: Carol is rushing around on Air Force One and sending out videos to the 13 begging people to resist the hive invasion.

End of the season: now she acts like business as usual. Why would any free person want to meet and discuss resisting the alien invasion? 

60 days has changed Carol from day 6.

# 16:00 

Dear reader of this no-audience GitHub art project (GitHub as medium of artwork) 

I was set up and disappointed at first, but now the show is really going where I was concerned since December 16, 2009 and my personal travel to Africa for the Ara Spring in year 2010.

Language. Here the smartphone in airplane mode, offline, can bridge the language gaps of humanity. An author / writer, English, Tower of Babel!

Tower of Babel has been my major concern before this show as ever announced. We have the Internet / World Wide web, Unicode standard for many characters, but we do use filter-bubbles and toxic clergy systems to block each other out as humans.

This whole scene has been depicting the alienation of language and strangers. Immigration. Calling to the April 2021 book by President George W. Bush https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Many,_One:_Portraits_of_America%27s_Immigrants - as the USA created the Internet network, but we don't use the tools to come together, we are alienated and impatient with humans and block them / close our doors.

# 19:00 "you are against them, no?"

"You are against them, no?" ... "I watched your video"

He believes in video tape message that could have been easily faked. But does not trust { their transportation, their food delivery, Carol's house }

But he risked his life from a video that could have been altered and faked.

Huge topic here of people and media ecology. The Minute 22 Episode One roots of Finnegans Wake media ecology.

* University of Toronto professor: "Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966

The whole situation of trusting a 78 second message from outer space, trusting a VHS tape delivered to the door. Trusting canned pet food in a storage unit. Where trust is placed, in content of a influencer (Carol) instead. Rats in a maze of advertising / marketing / product placement of billionaires story here.

Testing the radio signal on his ham radio. Belief in signals but blocking out human persons. Metaphor of the Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul fandom who thinks bad guys are sexy role models. Who memorize and recite characters who murder and profit off human suffering of meth drugs. While the same people never bothered to memorize the liens printed in Latin on on the dollar bill. "Pluribus" and other foundation phrases of the nation unknown while Walter White and Saul dialog memorized as audience priorities. Glamorizing villains and killers who seek obscene wealth and poison our future. https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/hollywood-writer-vince-gilligan-warns-against-glamorizing-villains.html

&nbsp;

# 19:00:30 Carol: "They are Still Human Beings"

Carol has calmed down from her panics. Now she asserts the humanity even in alien species. 

BILL MOYERS: Still, it’s feasible to me that these stories of heroes could become sort of a tranquilizer, invoking in us the benign passivity of watching instead of acting. And the other side of it is that **our world seems drained of spiritual values. People feel impotent. To me, that’s the curse of modern society, the impotence, the ennui that people feel, the alienation of people from the world order** around them. Maybe we need some hero who will give voice to our deeper longing.

* Moyers: "the world order", the New World Order in Latin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novus_ordo_seclorum along with "Pluribus". Vince Gilligan and crew are "we need some kind of hero" to reform our monomyth stories and understandings of mythology inheritance. 

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: This is exactly T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land that you are describing, a sociological stagnation of inauthentic lives and living that has settled upon us, and that evokes nothing of our spiritual life, **our potentialities**, or even our physical courage — until, of course, it gets us into one of its **inhuman wars**.

* They are the last of the free thinkers... standing in a dry wasteland visually during this peer to peer encounter. 

MOYERS: You’re not against technology, are you?

CAMPBELL: Not at all.

# 00:20:30 Abandoned for 40 days

Christmas eve / Christmas day season ending. 

A huge clue in this line about morality in the desert of ABQ. Carol seems avoidant / ignorant of Levant mythology (given her age 16 Christian torture camp of her parents, this makes sense). But ABQ is more Christian than Native American for a white suburban life. He is a man that seems to have Christian knowledge, both "new world" (South America / North America / Central America) year 1492 Spaniards / Christians. Different languages, but Roman Empire / Spain / England umbrella of Jesus Christmas Eve / Christmas Day age 3 indoctrination of parents with Santa and Jesus for both persons?

They are sitting on an inheritance from the Levant and tower of Babel without recognizing it. And the smartphone, even in airplane mode, can translate for them. Yet, they do not seek out world peace without such global 78-second RNA circumstances. Very much Skywalker ranch "Power of Myth" messages about not keeping the good parts; MLK Jr's message of not keeping good ideas from Levant stories.

"In the Torah and Bible, "40 days/years" signifies trials, testing, preparation, and spiritual cleansing, often leading to divine revelation or new beginnings, seen in Moses's fast on Sinai (Torah), the Israelites' 40 years in the desert (Torah/Bible), Elijah's 40-day journey (Bible), and Jesus's 40 days of temptation (Bible) before his ministry. It's a pattern showing how God refines people through hardship for a greater purpose, with 40 representing a complete period of testing before breakthrough."

Torah (Old Testament) Examples

* Moses on Sinai: Moses spent 40 days and nights fasting on Mount Sinai to receive the Torah (Ten Commandments) from God, a time of deep communion and preparation.
* Israel's Wilderness Wandering: The Israelites wandered the desert for 40 years as a generation-long test after the spies explored Canaan for 40 days, a period of purification before entering the Promised Land.
* Flood: The rain fell for 40 days and nights during Noah's flood, signifying a global cleansing and new start. 

Bible (New Testament) Examples
* Jesus's Temptation: Jesus fasted and was tempted by Satan in the wilderness for 40 days, overcoming what Israel failed to do, paving the way for his ministry.
* Post-Resurrection Appearances: Jesus appeared to his disciples for 40 days after his resurrection before his ascension, a time of teaching and commissioning.
* Elijah's Journey: The prophet Elijah traveled 40 days and nights to Mount Horeb (Sinai) after fleeing Jezebel, finding God in the quiet. 

General Meaning of "40"

* Testing & Trial: A common theme is that 40 days/years are a period where people are tested in solitude to see if they rely on God or worldly things.
* Preparation: It's a time to prepare for a significant spiritual change, covenant, or new phase (like birth, as in 40 weeks of gestation, or a ruler's reign).
* Completeness: It marks a complete cycle of testing, often preceding a breakthrough or divine intervention (e.g., after 40 days, the giant falls or the rain stops).

# 00:20:45 Carol's denial of love

Manousos Oviedo asks: Why did they come back?

Carol pauses like the hive mind does while thinking, lies through her teeth that she doesn't know why they came back after 40 days.

Carol made a massive message in the circle in front of her house to invite them back, she begged them to come back after 40 days of fasting without them in ABQ. Carol sent out fireworks, Native American smoke signals, and messages to the sky / broadcasting her romance.

* Carol's denial of Love on season end Christmas. Bible verse Ephesians 4:25

* "Native American messages in circles, primarily through Talking Circles, emphasize equality, respect, healing, and interconnectedness, using the circle to symbolize wholeness, life cycles, and unity, allowing everyone a voice through focused listening"


&nbsp;

# 00:25:15 who on phone?

Despite being Pirate Lady on phone (a familiar comfort voice / comfort sex), Carol has concluded it is *always them* she talks too. The booze begins, back into author James Joyce's dream state for Carol.

After 60 days, she can not penetrate what she considers the essential person. (ToDo: Little Prince quotes).

# 00:30:30 Latin language "ToTo"

Latin show title, go deeper on Spanish language to same meaning. *Todo* Spanish --> *ToTo* Latin

The pet dog, house pet Zosia of Wizard of Oz Dorthy. 

OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bmBYgGjkfQ 24,143 views July 24, 2021 Going to sell my house in town (ABQ). And i'll be there to shine in your world. Take me by the hand, show me!

* "The band Toto's name has dual origins: initially a placeholder on demo tapes from The Wizard of Oz dog, but officially adopted from the Latin phrase "in toto," meaning "all-encompassing," reflecting their versatile musical style. While the dog inspired the initial scribble, the band embraced the Latin meaning to highlight their ability to play various genres like rock, pop, jazz, and R&B."
