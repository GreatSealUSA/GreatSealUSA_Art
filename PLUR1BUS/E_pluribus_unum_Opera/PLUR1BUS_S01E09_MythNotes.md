* 1988 Skywalker Ranch lessons for Science Fiction film and television audiences.

    * BILL MOYERS: And what do they say to you about women?

    * JOSEPH CAMPBELL: They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The **out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy.
Now, today there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity**. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.” Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and **our own Western subjugation of the female** is a function of biblical thinking.

# 06:00 

The expectations of what this was about, Carol's eggs and surrogate motherhood. The Christmas eve rituals of childbirth.

"We would never hurt you" to the young woman with the pregnancy gift in a stainless steel canister. 

Throughout human history, tens of thousands of years and longer, pregnancy has been an extreme health risk to women. A pregnant woman is slowed down / pained / vulnerable. She needs special foods  / nutrition. She can bleed out or have a dead fetus inside her body. Coffin birth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin_birth

Maternal Sepsis: A life-threatening condition where the body’s extreme response to a pregnancy-related infection causes organ failure and potentially death.

Life on Earth has not been pain-free and honest sincere about the real risk when there wasn't 911 telephone serve, air lift to hospital, and library full of books on medical knowledge.

She asks "Will it hurt" to the elders, childbirth if rarely painless for any human anywhere in history. "No, Kusimayu, not one bit!"

* Young woman whose name means "River of Joy" in Quechua, is one of the few individuals who have not been absorbed into a global hivemind - one of the free-thinking 13 is manipulated by the { advertising, marketing, selling commutations and manipulation methods } of those in power in the world.

~~Further, they have manipulated this young woman to go against the desires and wishes of another free individual, Carol. Turning a free person into an agent of abuse of another free person.~~

&nbsp;

The tear-down of the ritual, the ceremony is over. The power of human rituals to overcome fear.

* "Then the little couple is pulled out and roasted and eaten that very evening. The ritual is the repetition of the original act of the killing of a god followed by the coming of food from the dead savior. In the sacrifice of the Mass, you are taught that this is the body and blood of the Savior. You take it to you, and you turn inward, and there he works within you."

&nbsp;

# 12:00 end of season

Start of the season: Carol is rushing around on Air Force One and sending out videos to the 13 begging people to resist the hive invasion.

End of the season: now she acts like business as usual. Why would any free person want to meet and discuss resisting the alien invasion? 

60 days has changed Carol from day 6.

&nbsp;

# 16:00 

Dear reader of this no-audience GitHub art project (GitHub as medium of artwork) 

I was set up and disappointed at first, but now the show is really going where I was concerned since December 16, 2009 and my personal travel to Africa for the Ara Spring in year 2010.

Language. Here the smartphone in airplane mode, offline, can bridge the language gaps of humanity. An author / writer, English, Tower of Babel!

Tower of Babel has been my major concern before this show as ever announced. We have the Internet / World Wide web, Unicode standard for many characters, but we do use filter-bubbles and toxic clergy systems to block each other out as humans.

This whole scene has been depicting the alienation of language and strangers. Immigration. Calling to the April 2021 book by President George W. Bush https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Many,_One:_Portraits_of_America%27s_Immigrants - as the USA created the Internet network, but we don't use the tools to come together, we are alienated and impatient with humans and block them / close our doors.

&nbsp;

# 19:00 "you are against them, no?"

"You are against them, no?" ... "I watched your video"

He believes in video tape message that could have been easily faked. But does not trust { their transportation, their food delivery, Carol's house }

But he risked his life from a video that could have been altered and faked.

Huge topic here of people and media ecology. The Minute 22 Episode One roots of Finnegans Wake media ecology.

* University of Toronto professor: "Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966

The whole situation of trusting a 78 second message from outer space, trusting a VHS tape delivered to the door. Trusting canned pet food in a storage unit. Where trust is placed, in content of a influencer (Carol) instead. Rats in a maze of advertising / marketing / product placement of billionaires story here.

Testing the radio signal on his ham radio. Belief in signals but blocking out human persons. Metaphor of the Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul fandom who thinks bad guys are sexy role models. Who memorize and recite characters who murder and profit off human suffering of meth drugs. While the same people never bothered to memorize the liens printed in Latin on on the dollar bill. "Pluribus" and other foundation phrases of the nation unknown while Walter White and Saul dialog memorized as audience priorities. Glamorizing villains and killers who seek obscene wealth and poison our future. https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/hollywood-writer-vince-gilligan-warns-against-glamorizing-villains.html

&nbsp;

# 19:00:30 Carol: "They are Still Human Beings"

Carol has calmed down from her panics. Now she asserts the humanity even in alien species. 

BILL MOYERS: Still, it’s feasible to me that these stories of heroes could become sort of a tranquilizer, invoking in us the benign passivity of watching instead of acting. And the other side of it is that **our world seems drained of spiritual values. People feel impotent. To me, that’s the curse of modern society, the impotence, the ennui that people feel, the alienation of people from the world order** around them. Maybe we need some hero who will give voice to our deeper longing.

* Moyers: "the world order", the New World Order in Latin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novus_ordo_seclorum along with "Pluribus". Vince Gilligan and crew are "we need some kind of hero" to reform our monomyth stories and understandings of mythology inheritance. 

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: This is exactly T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land that you are describing, a sociological stagnation of inauthentic lives and living that has settled upon us, and that evokes nothing of our spiritual life, **our potentialities**, or even our physical courage — until, of course, it gets us into one of its **inhuman wars**.

* They are the last of the free thinkers... standing in a dry wasteland visually during this peer to peer encounter. 

MOYERS: You’re not against technology, are you?

CAMPBELL: Not at all. 

&nbsp;

# 00:20:30 Abandoned for 40 days

Christmas eve / Christmas day season ending. 

A huge clue in this line about morality in the desert of ABQ. Carol seems avoidant / ignorant of Levant mythology (given her age 16 Christian torture camp of her parents, this makes sense). But ABQ is more Christian than Native American for a white suburban life. He is a man that seems to have Christian knowledge, both "new world" (South America / North America / Central America) year 1492 Spaniards / Christians. Different languages, but Roman Empire / Spain / England umbrella of Jesus Christmas Eve / Christmas Day age 3 indoctrination of parents with Santa and Jesus for both persons?

They are sitting on an inheritance from the Levant and tower of Babel without recognizing it. And the smartphone, even in airplane mode, can translate for them. Yet, they do not seek out world peace without such global 78-second RNA circumstances. Very much Skywalker ranch "Power of Myth" messages about not keeping the good parts; MLK Jr's message of not keeping good ideas from Levant stories.

"In the Torah and Bible, "40 days/years" signifies trials, testing, preparation, and spiritual cleansing, often leading to divine revelation or new beginnings, seen in Moses's fast on Sinai (Torah), the Israelites' 40 years in the desert (Torah/Bible), Elijah's 40-day journey (Bible), and Jesus's 40 days of temptation (Bible) before his ministry. It's a pattern showing how God refines people through hardship for a greater purpose, with 40 representing a complete period of testing before breakthrough."

Torah (Old Testament) Examples

* Moses on Sinai: Moses spent 40 days and nights fasting on Mount Sinai to receive the Torah (Ten Commandments) from God, a time of deep communion and preparation.
* Israel's Wilderness Wandering: The Israelites wandered the desert for 40 years as a generation-long test after the spies explored Canaan for 40 days, a period of purification before entering the Promised Land.
* Flood: The rain fell for 40 days and nights during Noah's flood, signifying a global cleansing and new start. 

Bible (New Testament) Examples
* Jesus's Temptation: Jesus fasted and was tempted by Satan in the wilderness for 40 days, overcoming what Israel failed to do, paving the way for his ministry.
* Post-Resurrection Appearances: Jesus appeared to his disciples for 40 days after his resurrection before his ascension, a time of teaching and commissioning.
* Elijah's Journey: The prophet Elijah traveled 40 days and nights to Mount Horeb (Sinai) after fleeing Jezebel, finding God in the quiet. 

General Meaning of "40"

* Testing & Trial: A common theme is that 40 days/years are a period where people are tested in solitude to see if they rely on God or worldly things.
* Preparation: It's a time to prepare for a significant spiritual change, covenant, or new phase (like birth, as in 40 weeks of gestation, or a ruler's reign).
* Completeness: It marks a complete cycle of testing, often preceding a breakthrough or divine intervention (e.g., after 40 days, the giant falls or the rain stops). 

&nbsp;

# 00:20:45 Carol's denial of love

Manousos Oviedo asks: Why did they come back?

Carol pauses like the hive mind does while thinking, lies through her teeth that she doesn't know why they came back after 40 days.

Carol made a massive message in the circle in front of her house to invite them back, she begged them to come back after 40 days of fasting without them in ABQ. Carol sent out fireworks, Native American smoke signals, and messages to the sky / broadcasting her romance.

* Carol's denial of Love on season end Christmas. Bible verse Ephesians 4:25

* "Native American messages in circles, primarily through Talking Circles, emphasize equality, respect, healing, and interconnectedness, using the circle to symbolize wholeness, life cycles, and unity, allowing everyone a voice through focused listening"


&nbsp;

# 00:25:15 who on phone?

Despite being Pirate Lady on phone (a familiar comfort voice / comfort sex), Carol has concluded it is *always them* she talks too. The booze begins, back into author James Joyce's dream state for Carol.

After 60 days, she can not penetrate what she considers the essential person. (ToDo: Little Prince quotes).

&nbsp;

# 00:30:30 Latin language "ToTo"

Latin show title, go deeper on Spanish language to same meaning. *Todo* Spanish --> *ToTo* Latin

* "The band Toto's name has dual origins: initially a placeholder on demo tapes from The Wizard of Oz dog, but officially adopted from the Latin phrase "in toto," meaning "all-encompassing," reflecting their versatile musical style. While the dog inspired the initial scribble, the band embraced the Latin meaning to highlight their ability to play various genres like rock, pop, jazz, and R&B."

# 00:31:30 Troubadour Love, R. O. M. A. empire

Now we are getting extremely deep and serious about a lesson ignored and avoided in society since year 1988. Oh boy. West Gate hotel, Elvis. "The Gate to the West" that is in Vegas symbolism.

The communal sleeping Zosia offered an orgy (ToDo: find episode timestamp, link GitHub location)

Did they have a wedding? nope. Did Carol do a ritual, like "going steady", a ring, a promise of a marriage. NOPE! Carol tossed out all those rituals and threshold crossings!

Now we are in the deep shit of Carol's parents and the age 16 Lesbian internment torture camp. Now it is all coming out about USA society reality. The ignored 1988 book! Vince Gilligan has done it! February 15, 2025 he named Darth Vader in a subtle way. He invoked Skywalker Ranch 1988 connections!

Marriage and "monster state" society of ICE and Africa / Polish immigrant ownership. And how Carol's phone call in Spanish was to only curse-out and hate message. It is ALL coming out in the symbolism here. There is no real RNA message of 78 seconds in this fiction story, but this topic is NON-FICTION USA ABQ Vegas "West Gate" gate-keeping of understanding and compassion hotel and 1988 book lessons for science fiction audiences! Vince Gilligan has DONE IT NOW ON CHRISTMAS! I personally was married in Vegas, it is a popular marriage spot. Heartbreak Hotel Elvis.

&nbsp;

### Landing on 1988 Protest Very Dangerous

The Catholic year 1210 hive mind protest! Roman empire! Levant John One One authoring! BIG SHIT!

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: In the Middle Ages, that was the kind of marriage that was sanctified by the Church. And so the **troubadour idea of real person-to-person Amor was very dangerous.**

MOYERS: Because it was heresy?

CAMPBELL: Not only heresy, it was adultery, what might be called spiritual adultery. Since **the marriages were all arranged by society,** the love that came from the meeting of the eyes was of a higher spiritual value.

For example, in the Tristan romance, Isolde is engaged to marry King Mark. They have never seen each other. Tristan is sent to fetch Isolde to Mark. Isolde’s mother prepares a love potion, so that the two who are to be married will have real love for each other. And this love potion is put in the charge of the nurse, who is to go with Isolde. The love potion is left unguarded, and Tristan and Isolde think it’s wine, and they drink it. They’re overtaken with love. But they had already been in love, they just didn’t know it. The love potion just touched it off. One remembers that kind of experience from one’s own youth.
The problem from the troubadour point of view is that King Mark and Isolde, who are to be married, are not really qualified for love. They have never even seen each other. The true marriage is the marriage that springs from the recognition of identity in the other, and the physical union is simply the sacrament in which that is confirmed. It doesn’t start the other way around, with the physical interest that then becomes spiritualized. It starts from the spiritual impact of love—Amor.

MOYERS: Christ spoke of “the adulterer at heart,” the violation of the union that takes place spiritually, in the mind and heart.

CAMPBELL: And every marriage was such a violation when it was arranged by the society and not by the heart. That’s the sense of courtly love in the Middle Ages. It is in direct contradiction to the way of the Church. The word AMOR spelt backwards is ROMA, **the Roman Catholic Church, which was justifying marriages that were simply political and social** in their character. And so came this movement validating individual choice, what I call following your bliss.

But there’s danger, too, of course. In the Tristan romance, when the young couple has drunk their love potion and Isolde’s nurse realizes what has happened, she goes to Tristan and says, “You have drunk your death.” And Tristan says, “By my death, do you mean this pain of love?” — because that was one of the main points, that one should feel the sickness of love. There’s no possible fulfillment in this world of that identity one is experiencing. Tristan says, “If by my death, you mean this agony of love, that is my life. If by my death, you mean the punishment that we are to suffer if discovered, I accept that. And if by my death, you mean eternal punishment in the fires of hell, I accept that, too.” Now, **that’s big stuff**.

MOYERS: Especially for medieval Catholics, who believed in a literal hell. So what’s the significance of what Tristan was saying?

CAMPBELL: What he was saying is that his love is bigger even than death and pain, than anything. **This is the affirmation** of the pain of life in a big way.

MOYERS: And he would choose this pain of love now even though it might mean everlasting pain and damnation in hell.

CAMPBELL: Any life career that you choose in following your bliss should be chosen with that sense—that nobody can frighten me off from this thing. And no matter what happens, this is the validation of my life and action.

MOYERS: And in choosing love, too?

CAMPBELL: In choosing love, too.

# 00:48:30 Carol's Egg Basket

In build up to this scene, ice settings, like the Helen ice bed / ice hotel. Metaphors of state enforcement via northern police lights / ice / lesbian outlaws. The ski resort / lodge in the ice / lodging ice hotel / drinks.

All this thrusts the Christmas December 25 season (Episode 9, season ending, Winter Solstice) real-world to the real-world Easter Sunday "eggs" emphasis throughout the show. Omelets and Carol's frozen eggs. Carol uses the word "my eggs".

[March 25 spring fertility vs. December 25 birthing. **Lady Day** in March.](../Everything_Media_Ecology/Everything_is_Lady_Day.md) Who is the book author, story writer, of science fiction John 1:1 - womankind of outer-space messages from an alien planet?

&nbsp;

# 00:49:40 The Title of the series now in-show

Now inside the show, the title of the series as messages for the first time (that I have witnessed, maybe a dollar bill, and the Air Force One POTUS seal).

The stem cells and "Pluri" invasion.

&nbsp;

# 00:50:00 We have to Fix You Lesbian

"We have to do this because we love you" 

Age 16 Lesbian internment camp against Carol by her parental figures / God forced by Catholic Church / Roman Empire (see notes on 00:31:30 earlier in this page), in a woods setting the the ski resort. The trap of the Catholic fertility forced { abortion, birth control } on women. Even if it is a "believer" woman partner, the independent free (USA Pluribus) woman stands up like Malala in Swat Valley Pakistan does for transgenders against the Mecca empire of Quran hive mind. https://assembly.malala.org/stories/how-using-trans-inclusive-language-benefits-us-all

&nbsp;

# 00:54:30 You Win

Save the galaxy, as the hive mind intends to re transmit to other planets. Death Star thinking of the rebels.

USA Latin *Pluribus*, Air Force One, Nuclear Football dialog at Air Force One meeting table. New Mexico is where the alien invasion was received at the VLA. New Mexico is where humanity created the nuclear bomb. Walter White is a scientist / science teacher and the Zero Hour was at the ABQ New Mexico location of Walter's grave.

I'm surprised how many people keep skipping the book author, book publisher, book tour, book writing connections. Stephen King, the famous American book author, made a book about an atomic bomb in Vegas.

The West Gate hotel in Vegas, where Carol took her police car to visit. Stephen King has a nuclear bomb book about a military virus outbreak (lab rat escape situation like Pluribus).

People never read Stephen King's virus story?

On-screen countdown bomb timers every episode. Trinity Site in New Mexico, *Jornada del Muerto*, Trinity ending of the season on Trinity holiday. Symbolism and book reading seems dead like Helen is dead!

....

Of course, "you win" isn't a win. Writing and poetry has only been played with a chapter from Carl's new writing. The Great Seal Eagle points to the olive branch, and Carol hasn't used lecturing very much / diplomacy very much. She turns to the man who uses the arrows and aggression of the Great Seal eagle first. He was reading books like a Walter White man of science and electronics, not spiritual storytelling and Joyce / Carol's books / etc. So that's likely the focus of the next season. Creating new laws and conventions of a "liberated" humanity, the culture of the Rebels against the Empire hive mind.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Ending of Season

American Brinkmanship. Shipping relationship of an aggressive man to Carol's circle. New Mexico holy lands of the atomic bomb creation by mankind. Planetary defense rebels programming.

Carol hasn't done the Halloween Germany reformation, maybe she will work on that and use an EMP to sever the hive mind / non-destructive space explosion to break the radio signals.

Vince Gilligan has gone out of his way to assert that the story is about Carol being a good person. So injecting individual Troubadour year 1210 free love against the Roman Empire West Gate gatekeeping I think is the deep story here. Elvis music has been cooking on the side burner, and the Elvis artwork core has excellent thinking and communications talent with the hive mind. A true ambassador. And Elvis USA Rock and Roll can save our mortal soul if Carol brings that into the Trinity of those making The Stand against the Roman Levant mythos empire.

New Mexico electromagnetic bomb, with the airwaves of wireless F.M. Radio. The Day the Music of the Hive Mind Died and Good old Elvis rose from the dead like Tim Finnegan! Rumors of Elvis not being dead is huge American mythos. Helen is dancing in her grave to James Joyce's writings! Go Carol, go! The marching band refused to yield, what is the yield on that Trinity Test New Mexico Electromagnetic Pulse music device?

OPERA_A Carol still remembers maybe she can make those people dance. But February 15, 2025 WGA Vince Gilligan speech made me shiver about how bad the social media cesspool was. Something touched me deep inside, the day the Pluribus Great Seal metaphors died. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRpiBpDy7MQ 
63,477,337 views November 10, 2021 - did *you write* the book of Love, Carol? If The Bible is reformed? Now do you believe in Rock Music, Carol? Can you teach the hive mind how to dance real slow? Fallout shelter, bomb lyric.

# Air Force One / Air Force Thirteen

1. An air lift helicopter drop vs. truck was used to drop the bomb at Carol's circle / driveway. Drone drop of trash / flying camera monitoring the ambulance arrival in Episode Nine themes abound.

2. Air spreading at the Zero Hour minute 22 of Episode One. Carol commenting on the air delivery of the alien invasion message to physical bodies. Absorbing the alien 78 second message in weaponized form in New Mexico.

3. Air Force One nuclear football dialog, command and control meeting, where Carol said "pod people" and alien invasion and turning off all recording and listening devices.

4. 13, the Great Seal of the United States of America and 13.

5. Time frame of Episode Nine... Christmas 2025 / magical outer-space prengancy from a baby-daddy on planet Eden or beyond.

&nbsp;

"the number 13 relates to hydrogen bombs through the new **U.S.** B61-13 gravity bomb, a modern thermonuclear weapon **announced in 2023 and with its first unit completed in 2025**, designed for increased yield and targeting hardened sites, though it's a gravity bomb (air-dropped)"

"The B61-13 is a high-yield strategic nuclear bomb and, if detonated at high altitude, it would produce a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) capable of disrupting or damaging unprotected electronics and power grids over a large area. The specific characteristics of the EMP (such as its voltage per meter) depend on the altitude and yield setting used at the time of detonation, information that is generally classified.  The B61-13 itself is a variable-yield ("dial-a-yield") weapon with a maximum yield reportedly around 360 kilotons (kT)."

"the B61-13 nuclear gravity bomb is heavily tied to New Mexico forces, specifically Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), which lead the design, engineering, and critical components for the weapon, working alongside the Air Force and other national facilities to bring this modern, higher-yield bomb to production for the U.S. nuclear deterrent"

"The first B61-13 unit was assembled in May 2025 at the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas"

"The B61-13, a new US gravity nuclear bomb, has had its first unit assembled at Pantex (near Amarillo, TX) in May 2025, with delivery (likely by specialized air transport, not routine helicopters) to bases like Kirtland AFB (ABQ) for deployment, but specific helicopter transport details aren't public; while the B61-12 weighs about 825 lbs, the B61-13 is expected to be similar or slightly heavier, a manageable load for heavy-lift military helicopters, though exact weights are classified."

"Kirtland AFB (ABQ) is central to the B61-13 nuclear gravity bomb program, as the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) headquartered there manages its development and integration, working with Sandia/Los Alamos labs on design and production"

"In the Apple TV+ show Pluribus, Zosia (Karolina Wydra) pilots a ** UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter** in Episode 9 to transport a virus payload, a detail highlighted by the actress learning to fly military aircraft"

&nbsp;

"The image shows a Bell 412 utility helicopter, a twin-turbine aircraft developed from the Bell 212 model. Key features and information include:  It is identified as a "FIRE" helicopter, likely used for firefighting operations.  The helicopter features a composite four-blade main rotor system, which improves performance and reduces noise compared to its predecessor.  It has a maximum speed of 259 km/h (161 mph) and a range of 745 km (463 miles)."

"The Agusta-Bell AB412 can carry a substantial external load of up to 5,000 lbs (2,268 kg), which is typically used for dropping water during firefighting operations. This capacity is more than sufficient to accommodate the weight of two adult women in the cabin and a significant amount of cargo dropped from below."

"From Albuquerque (ABQ) to Kirtland AFB, the helicopter distance is very short, essentially just a few miles as Kirtland is located within the greater ABQ area, serving as a major air hub for training and operations"

&nbsp;

Did you pilot the helicopter that drops off the A-bomb?

GILLIGAN No, I’m pretty proud of my piloting skills, but I am in awe of our two different pilots. In episode two, a pilot named Greg dropped off that excavator, and man, that guy’s a pro. Then there was **a pilot named Ken who dropped off the atom bomb in the final episode**. I am humbled by those guys. I could have brought that thing in and set it down within 10 feet of where it was supposed to go, but those guys make me look like I don’t even know what I’m doing. I couldn’t have done it over and over again like those guys. They nailed it to the exact spot time and time again. Those guys made it look easy, and that’s beyond my skillset.

SMITH I thought Karolina \[Wydra\] was piloting. Was it not Karolina? 

GILLIGAN (Laughs.) It looked like it was her, didn’t it? That’s the magic of movies. She really looked like she was flying that thing. It was very well done.

"The actress who plays Carol Sturka in Pluribus is Rhea Seehorn, and she is approximately 5 feet 4½ inches (1.64 m) tall. The helicopter appears to be a Bell 206, 406, or 407 model, as indicated by search results featuring similar aircraft with "COASTAL" livery."

"The exact weight that the helicopter can carry for "lifting and drop" (external load operations) with two adults in the front seats depends heavily on which specific Bell model it is (likely a 206L or 407), its specific configuration, and environmental conditions like altitude and temperature."

ChatGPT (not logged in) instead of Google: 

"From the underside and in-flight details, the helicopter can be identified with high confidence.

🚁 Helicopter Identification (confirmed)    
Model: Bell 412 (very likely a Bell 412EP)     

Key visual features that confirm it:

Twin-engine exhausts on top of the cabin (blurred by rotor wash)
→ rules out Bell 206 / 407 (single-engine)     
Skid landing gear with the characteristic Bell 412 geometry    
Wide, boxy fuselage (much broader than AS350/H125)    
Rectangular cabin windows and cockpit window shape typical of the 412    
“FIRE” marking on the belly — common on municipal fire/rescue aircraft    
Belly-mounted equipment port (often camera, searchlight, or sensor)    
Tail boom and proportions match the 412 exactly"

OPERA_A Carol has "nothing to lose, fire away, fire away!" https://youtu.be/JRfuAukYTKg?t=121

&nbsp;

Another stab with ChatGPT logged-in:  

"The overall proportions of the cabin and tail boom, plus the fire-specific belly marking, strongly match an Airbus AS350 (modern designation: H125) rather than a Bell 206. This is the exact model most fire departments, contractors, and productions rely on because it:

Carries more payload     
Handles heat and altitude better    
Is extremely common in real-world fire operations (especially in the US)"

# See Great Seal Eye to Eye

Where is this show going after Season One, with the Hive Mind fleeing ABQ? Carol trying to turn heads with the nuke bomb?

I think with 4 seasons of the show, the story is going to be about the 13 free being essential to the hive mind. They / We / All / Pluribus already treat Carol like a commander in chief on Air Force One to the hive.

II think Carol is going to reprogram the hive mind, rebels against the empire. There ain't no bad guy... just teaching / learning / book writing / book authoring / schooling to do about love and peering from Carol. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h16DmdQvxB0

# Great Beyond

If it makes it 4 seasons:

The phone call again when the hive mind crashed I think shows this is going for global mythology. We have Elvis in the wings... Hindu / Buddhism. We were told Zosia lost someone, but not sure why she is in Africa dressed like Islam. The Peruvian woman represented native non-Levant cultures.
