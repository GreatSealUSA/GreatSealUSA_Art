### Track 1: Somewhere there is RNA

1999, Y2K   
"Vertical Horizon" - point those dishes into outer space, the Inner Reaches of Outer Space.    

Lyrics:    
Somewhere, there's speaking (RNA), it's already coming in    
Oh, and it's rising at the back of your mind    
You never could get it unless you were fed it   
Now you're here and you don't know why

He / She / Pirate Lady / Pirate Man

### Track 2: Understanding Carol

Carol hates her audience, mocks her audience, holds back on her "Bitter coming out of the closet" story she labored on for 4.5 years - keeping truth from her audience.

Understanding what Carol believes in:

"Tonic - If You Could Only See (Closed-Captioned)"   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfg6-4mBs6Y

1. "Maybe you would understand Carol's feelings"
2. Understand Carol "what I must do"

Understanding Carol: When you hate the whole world, ONE person's love you prize. But Carol's attitude is also the creation of toxic society. The whole world becomes a hate dumping ground for one tiny island (couple) of love. And why Carol must do what she does. Egoism book dumping into society.

### Track 3: Two pirates sailing away

"Styx - The Best Of Times (Official Video)"

1. Despite a safe wealthy area, next to empty - the key is needed to open the door. And Carol knows no other way to penetrade her home defense. No window and doors open.

2. Rumor has it is the end of Paradise for Carol and Helen in thier egomania, "fuck the rest of the world", baby just us two traveling and mocking our book audience and airport book sellers. Fuck the other authors of other books. Just the two in egomania.

3. If the world just passed us bay, as she did for 4.5 years hiding from USA society about her "Bitter coming out of the closet" of the gender of Pirate Lady to her audience.

4. It is REALLY only a world for two, fuck the whole humanity.

5. The headlines Read on the bar TV, Carol wishes paradise would bring back, her ego bubble / filter bubble. Helen is always around Carol's mind, the hive mind is always around.

6. Carol and Hellen's memories are all that she has to last a lifetime.

7. Carl takes *any risk* to tie back the hands of time. boozing, taking cars, racing to the hospital. 

8. Some day in the future episodes, WE WILL FIND, These Are The Best Of Times, Carolis NOW living in the REAL WORLD of planet Earth that birhed her.

### Track 4: Helen's Fall

Helen just wrecked the world with Finnegans Wake in a Public House. Carol has lost her partner, this *isn't what Carol planned*, Carol throws herself into the day, into society. Carol wishes the hive mind and Helen could understand, but Helen already understands The Wake / Bitter Awakening from pupa.

### Track 5: Carol and Helen placed thier bets

"10cc - The Things We Do For Love"   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0rf3_viTxk

Five years... they placed their bet on egoisma isolation. On feeding society trashy romance novels. Keeping the "coming out of the closet" of book character gender...

Now Carol feels like a part of her is dead (Helen), you tinnk the Hive Mind broke Carol from you, but then (next episode) she say that Carol is still here, and this was the greatest day for Humanity.

&nbsp;

### Track 6: Hive Mind Thoughts And Dreams Scattered

"Daryl Hall & John Oates - You Make My Dreams (Official HD Video)"    
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EErSKhC0CZs

Where were you, Carol? You make the Hive Mind's Deepest Dreams come through.

On a night... Finnegans Wake dreams of night have started for Carol at the Public House.

And Helen isn't the way Carol found her. When you marry, you do not know the future, you do not know if war will break out in Ukraine in year 2012 at your wedding... you have made an *eternal pledge* of all billions of years of the cosmos.. and you DO NOT KNOW if being Jewish in Germany in 1935 changes your future of your marriage.

Helen  is waiting for Carol to polish her book, the bitter birth of editing and refining the "Work in Progress" unpublished book.
