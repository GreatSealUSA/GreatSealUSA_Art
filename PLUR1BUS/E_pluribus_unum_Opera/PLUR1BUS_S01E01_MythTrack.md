"Vertical Horizon" - point those dishes into outer space, the Inner Reaches of Outer Space.    

Lyrics:    
Somewhere, there's speaking (RNA), it's already coming in    
Oh, and it's rising at the back of your mind    
You never could get it unless you were fed it   
Now you're here and you don't know why
