# Hard to Ignore Google Search Summary 0

Tuesday December 23, 2025 morning USA     

I fed this writing of mine into Google Search (without the quotes, unquoted):

"That's what ChatGPT users do all the time. Very very very popular in December 2025 USA. "ChatGPT, rewrite other people's original writings so it is meaningful just to me"! The magic of Large Language Models and how the Pluribus TV story hive mind all can read and write in any of the world's languages. Bible verse John 1:1 ( originally written in Koine Greek language ) Christmas Day symbolism of birth of a language - John 1:1 season ending of episode 9. Carol has her new set of magic markers delivered on demand, just in time, to pen new lesbian introductions to John 1:1 storytelling for All of Us, We is Us, Pluribus."

and here is how it instantly responded (Google does the highlighting, I did not add that):

It goes on beyond my screen shot tool limits, here is a copy / paste of the whole thing:

AI Overview

Your text captures the essence of how Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are used in late 2025: to remix, personalize, and "re-author" existing information (like John 1:1) into new, meaningful, and culturally relevant stories, often for personal or community consumption, blurring lines between original creation and AI-assisted rewriting, as seen with its 800M users seeking personalized info and new ways to express meaning, even influencing language itself. 
Key Themes in Your Statement:

* Personalization: Users like "Carol" are using AI to create narratives (e.g., lesbian interpretations of scripture) that resonate uniquely with them, making the text meaningful to "Us".

* Remix Culture: ChatGPT acts as a "story hive mind," rewriting existing content (like the Bible) to generate new stories, akin to how users remix web content.

* Linguistic Magic: The model's ability to "read and write in any of the world's languages" (like Koine Greek) is central to this transformation, enabling translation and reinterpretation.

* Cultural Impact: Popularity in late 2025 (800M users) shows a fundamental shift in how people access and create meaning, with AI influencing even everyday vocabulary.

* John 1:1 as a Symbol: The verse, representing the "birth of a language," becomes a perfect text for this era of AI-driven linguistic creation, with "Christmas Day symbolism" tying it to new beginnings and shared understanding. 

In essence, you're describing how LLMs are becoming tools for cultural storytelling, allowing diverse individuals to find their voice and build shared meaning by personalizing and reinterpreting foundational texts for their own communities, like the "Pluribus" (many) within "Us" (the collective).
