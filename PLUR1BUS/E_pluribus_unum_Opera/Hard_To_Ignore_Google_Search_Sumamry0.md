# Hard to Ignore Google Search Summary 0

Tuesday December 23, 2025 morning USA     

I fed this writing of mine into Google Search (without the quotes, unquoted):

"That's what ChatGPT users do all the time. Very very very popular in December 2025 USA. "ChatGPT, rewrite other people's original writings so it is meaningful just to me"! The magic of Large Language Models and how the Pluribus TV story hive mind all can read and write in any of the world's languages. Bible verse John 1:1 ( originally written in Koine Greek language ) Christmas Day symbolism of birth of a language - John 1:1 season ending of episode 9. Carol has her new set of magic markers delivered on demand, just in time, to pen new lesbian introductions to John 1:1 storytelling for All of Us, We is Us, Pluribus."

&nbsp;

And here is how it instantly responded (Google does the highlighting, I did not add that):

It goes on beyond my screen shot tool limits, here is a copy / paste of the whole thing:

AI Overview

Your text captures the essence of how Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are used in late 2025: to remix, personalize, and "re-author" existing information (like John 1:1) into new, meaningful, and culturally relevant stories, often for personal or community consumption, blurring lines between original creation and AI-assisted rewriting, as seen with its 800M users seeking personalized info and new ways to express meaning, even influencing language itself. 
Key Themes in Your Statement:

* Personalization: Users like "Carol" are using AI to create narratives (e.g., lesbian interpretations of scripture) that resonate uniquely with them, making the text meaningful to "Us".

* Remix Culture: ChatGPT acts as a "story hive mind," rewriting existing content (like the Bible) to generate new stories, akin to how users remix web content.

* Linguistic Magic: The model's ability to "read and write in any of the world's languages" (like Koine Greek) is central to this transformation, enabling translation and reinterpretation.

* Cultural Impact: Popularity in late 2025 (800M users) shows a fundamental shift in how people access and create meaning, with AI influencing even everyday vocabulary.

* John 1:1 as a Symbol: The verse, representing the "birth of a language," becomes a perfect text for this era of AI-driven linguistic creation, with "Christmas Day symbolism" tying it to new beginnings and shared understanding. 

In essence, you're describing how LLMs are becoming tools for cultural storytelling, allowing diverse individuals to find their voice and build shared meaning by personalizing and reinterpreting foundational texts for their own communities, like the "Pluribus" (many) within "Us" (the collective).

# Google: Past in Future

Tuesday, December 23, 2025 afternoon USA     
This one was pretty interesting, Google Search declaring that February 15, 2025 is in the future relating to science fiction storytelling.

* My Google search, without surrounding quotes: "I've read the book since I got it in year 1988, at least a dozen times. The TV show Pluribus is all called out in the book. Vince Gilligan on February 15, 2025 mentioned "Darth Vader" in his writers guild speech."

Response from Google Search:

<img width="2376" height="1186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2e203cc-6832-4b13-b56e-c8e9a6cf964e" />

&nbsp;

"I cannot find any information regarding a television show called Pluribus in connection with Vince Gilligan or any book published around or before 1988. There are also no records of Vince Gilligan mentioning "Darth Vader" in a speech on February 15, 2025, as that date is in the future."

"It is possible that the show name or the book title is different, or the event did not occur as described. The name Pluribus is often associated with the Latin phrase E pluribus unum ("Out of many, one"), which appears on U.S. currency and the Great Seal."

# Carol writing for "the Plebs" audiences

&nbsp;

Tuesday, December 23, 2025 afternoon USA    
Before Episode Nine has aired    

My Google Search, without the one set of outer-most surrounding quotes: "This is not a "ELI3", "ELI5" story. Vince Gilligan and his writing staff made this clear with minute 22 of Episode One (the Pluribus Pilot) and dialog about Finnegans Wake. That scene between Helen and Carol is also in the 1988 book. Helen and Carol discuss writing for "the plebs" fandom and doing reveals on social media before Helen falls backwards an dies (hitting her head)."

&nbsp;

Google Deep Dive response:

In the pilot episode of Pluribus (Apple TV+, 2025), written and directed by Vince Gilligan, the conversation you referenced occurs roughly 23 minutes into the episode between Carol Sturka (Rhea Seehorn) and her manager/partner Helen (Miriam Shor). 

* The scene and the connection to the 1988 book involve the following details:
The Finnegans Wake Discussion: While having drinks at a "Public House," Helen mentions having studied James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake in graduate school. She critiques the idea of inaccessible "high art," noting that the book made her miserable. She argues that if an author makes even one person happy (referring to Carol's popular romance novels written for "the plebs"), then they have achieved something meaningful, even if it isn't considered "art" by elitist standards.

* The 1988 Connection: The dialogue serves as a direct reference to the source material—the 1988 novel upon which the series is based—which similarly used the Joyce comparison to bridge the gap between "high literature" and genre fiction.

* Social Media & Fandom: The characters discuss the demands of their fandom, including the pressure to provide "reveals" and engagement on social media, which Carol finds exhausting and shallow.
Helen’s Death: Shortly after this conversation, the global "signal" hits. As the virus takes hold, Helen freezes, then falls backward, hitting her head on the concrete. While others in the tavern also collapse and eventually wake up into the hive mind, Helen dies from the trauma of the fall, leaving Carol as one of the few immune survivors in a world of connected "Others". 

This sequence is widely noted by viewers as the moment Gilligan signals that Pluribus is a complex, circular narrative—much like Finnegans Wake itself—rather than a straightforward sci-fi thriller. 

&nbsp;

**Commentary from me (who authored the search prompt line) about Google deep dive's response and assumptions***: The 1988 book in the Reddit reply context of this paragraph (fed by paste into Google deep dive after Google Search returned nothing)... was the 1988 book "Power of Myth" from science fiction fandom H.Q. Skywalker Ranch, California. A **non-fiction** book for fandom education. Without further context, the Google large language model assumed I was referencing a fiction novel. But the assertions about Helen and Finnegans Wake at minute 22 of Episode One are high remarkable and why I recorded this on GitHub. As more Pluribus audience media content is generated in the future. these large language models will give different answers down the line.
