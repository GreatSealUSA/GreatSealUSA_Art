Face the Face, Face to Face to Face *The Face* of Pirate Lady        
Is her face the face of? Latin: visio beatifica https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatific_vision

*Settle for*, settle down? Settle down the aggression? OPERA_A Is Heaven what you expected it to be with the outer space Kepler / Eden Christmas 2025 checkpoint? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBxmidwDy2Y Raise a Carol's egg with me, call her? First Kepler star I see... Settle down? Maybe another planet has a better radio message? I love you... well. No need to run, Carol's baby...

Carol can't believe that she believed Pirate Baby believed in deeper love.

"In all this talk of time"       
All this talk of time, the clock cowntdowns and countups.    

Carol is pushing like the famous myth of a rock and pushing up a maintain. But up a ski lift to a ski lodge. Pushing an Elephant up a hill.

Carol doesn't want to stay around the Hive Mind any more, Carol and Pirate Lady with dreams... but it seems Carol has found she is tossing love punchlines that were never there.

The music isn't singing, the song of heart to heart talks dead, Carol is looking at atomic answers from beyond conversation now.

Looking to the Kepler 22 stars, this is Eden?.... looking to the moon.

# TRACK: Drinking and Driving *The Pluribus*

Carol lives in the *land of confusion* over her deep emotional loss of Helen to the Public House minute 22 fall. Carol boozes, heavily, drinking away her rational mind systems to get the liquid courage flowing inside. Carol has the trigger and the device at the end sitting in her front house. Does the bomb have a DUI breathalyzer on it?

The end of the music video, the title of the Band, Genesis reborn / Christmas Day Eve Episode Nine inner reaching of Kepler 22 Minute 22 signals and electromagnetic pulse devices. Carol has one hell of a noisemaker for radio messages. Enough to knock out individuals into confusion of self-choice and free will from the New Mexico science labs.   

What a Terrible minute 22 Episode One dream... is Carol hung-over and parched in the morning when she wakes / woke from Helen's post-doc nursing booze advice at the Zero Hour countdown?

# TRACK: B61-13 for 13

13 for 13, a knockout blonde, angry at her jilted lover's hive minded ideals.

Military package metaphors abound.

B61-13 has no rocket, needs airlifted, but even atypical *firefight*ing a helicopter can take this, no B-52 required!

Carol likes Trains, but non-destructive air on high or space above will create more a radio signal than destruction!

"No one has a head... Some say she's from Mars... Or one of the seven stars that shine after three-thirty in the morning"

Planet Carol Clarity... 13, not 7, above. Stars are arranged in a radiant cluster.

But we aren't talking cluster munitions for this cluster-fucking!

Will *they* meet in the middle? The middle path?

George Lucas filmed lessons for science fiction fans in the future (Pluribus future) [published in 1988 book "Power of Myth"... Page 244](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA244&dq=%22One+early+writer+says+that+the+Grail+was+brought+from+heaven+by+the+neutral+angels%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X):

CAMPBELL: The wound is the wound of my passion and the agony of my love for this creature. The only one who can heal me is the one who delivered the blow. That’s a motif that appears in symbolic form in many medieval stories of the lance that delivers a wound. It is only when that lance can touch the wound again that the wound can be healed.

BILL MOYERS: Wasn’t there something of this idea in the legend of the Holy Grail?

CAMPBELL: In the monastic version of the story, the Grail is associated with Christ’s passion. The Grail is the chalice of the Last Supper and the chalice that received Christ’s blood when he was taken from the cross.

MOYERS: What does the Grail represent then?

CAMPBELL: There’s a very interesting statement about the origin of the Grail. One early writer says that the Grail was brought from heaven by the neutral angels. You see, during the war in heaven between God and Satan, between good and evil, some angelic hosts sided with Satan and some with God. The Grail was brought **down through the middle by the neutral angels. It represents that spiritual path** that is between pairs of opposites, between fear and desire, between good and evil.

The theme of the Grail **romance is that the land, the country, the whole territory of concern has been laid waste**. It is called a wasteland. And what is the nature of the wasteland? It is a land where everybody is living an inauthentic life, doing as other people do, **doing as you’re told, with no courage for your own life**.
