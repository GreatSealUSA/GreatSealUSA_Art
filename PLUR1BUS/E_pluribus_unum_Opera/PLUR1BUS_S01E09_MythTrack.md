Face the Face, Face to Face to Face *The Face* of Pirate Lady        
Is her face the face of? Latin: visio beatifica https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatific_vision

*Settle for*, settle down? Settle down the aggression? OPERA_A Is Heaven what you expected it to be with the outer space Kepler / Eden Christmas 2025 checkpoint? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBxmidwDy2Y Raise a Carol's egg with me, call her? First Kepler star I see... Settle down? Maybe another planet has a better radio message? I love you... well. No need to run, Carol's baby...

Carol can't believe that she believed Pirate Baby believed in deeper love.

"In all this talk of time"       
All this talk of time, the clock cowntdowns and countups.    

Carol is pushing like the famous myth of a rock and pushing up a maintain. But up a ski lift to a ski lodge. Pushing an Elephant up a hill.

Carol doesn't want to stay around the Hive Mind any more, Carol and Pirate Lady with dreams... but it seems Carol has found she is tossing love punchlines that were never there.

The music isn't singing, the song of heart to heart talks dead, Carol is looking at atomic answers from beyond conversation now.

Looking to the Kepler 22 stars, this is Eden?.... looking to the moon.

* "Come and join the Hive Mind Party dressed *to kill*" individuality and ITS HARD freedom.

* "The girls smile And people forget The snow packs as the skier tracks"

* The Hive Mind girls smile to Girly Girl Carol, together the smile and forget!

# TRACK: Drinking and Driving *The Pluribus*

Carol lives in the *land of confusion* over her deep emotional loss of Helen to the Public House minute 22 fall. Carol boozes, heavily, drinking away her rational mind systems to get the liquid courage flowing inside. Carol has the trigger and the device at the end sitting in her front house. Does the bomb have a DUI breathalyzer on it?

The end of the music video, the title of the Band, Genesis reborn / Christmas Day Eve Episode Nine inner reaching of Kepler 22 Minute 22 signals and electromagnetic pulse devices. Carol has one hell of a noisemaker for radio messages. Enough to knock out individuals into confusion of self-choice and free will from the New Mexico science labs.   

What a Terrible minute 22 Episode One dream... is Carol hung-over and parched in the morning when she wakes / woke from Helen's post-doc nursing booze advice at the Zero Hour countdown?

Invisible touch, the radio waves aren't so visible as they touch the Pluribus.   

* opening scene of the Genesis "Land of Confusion" music video, the puppet caricature of Nancy Reagan is reading "His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra" was a same-year 1986 best-selling book. Kitty Kelley author.
    * "The inclusion of the book was a specific satirical jab, as the book reportedly made claims of a past sexual relationship between Frank Sinatra and Nancy Davis (her maiden name) before her marriage to Ronald Reagan."

# TRACK: B61-13 for 13

13 for 13, a knockout blonde, angry at her jilted lover's hive minded ideals.

Military package metaphors abound.

B61-13 has no rocket, needs airlifted, but even atypical *firefight*ing a helicopter can take this, no B-52 required!

Carol likes Trains, but non-destructive air on high or space above will create more a radio signal than destruction!

"No one has a head... Some say she's from Mars... Or one of the seven stars that shine after three-thirty in the morning"

Planet Carol Clarity... 13, not 7, above. Stars are arranged in a radiant cluster.

But we aren't talking cluster munitions for this cluster-fucking!

# Track: Blondie Carol found divine Love

Seemed like the "Real Thing" from Pirate Lady...

In between, reading between Carol's book lines. Love is so confusing!

Heart of Glass, sand to glass devices...     

Push the individual Carol *me* aside... for mob mentality.
