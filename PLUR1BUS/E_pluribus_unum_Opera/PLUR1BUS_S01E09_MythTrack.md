Face the Face, Face to Face to Face *The Face* of Pirate Lady        
Is her face the face of? Latin: visio beatifica https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatific_vision

*Settle for*, settle down? Settle down the aggression? OPERA_A Is Heaven what you expected it to be with the outer space Kepler / Eden Christmas 2025 checkpoint? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBxmidwDy2Y Raise a Carol's egg with me, call her? First Kepler star I see... Settle down? Maybe another planet has a better radio message? I love you... well. No need to run, Carol's baby...

Carol can't believe that she believed Pirate Baby believed in deeper love.

"In all this talk of time"       
All this talk of time, the clock cowntdowns and countups.    

Carol is pushing like the famous myth of a rock and pushing up a maintain. But up a ski lift to a ski lodge. Pushing an Elephant up a hill.

Carol doesn't want to stay around the Hive Mind any more, Carol and Pirate Lady with dreams... but it seems Carol has found she is tossing love punchlines that were never there.

The music isn't singing, the song of heart to heart talks dead, Carol is looking at atomic answers from beyond conversation now.

Looking to the Kepler 22 stars, this is Eden?.... looking to the moon.
