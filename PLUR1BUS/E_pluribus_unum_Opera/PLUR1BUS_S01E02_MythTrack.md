## Track 1.1: Year One Day One (Episode Two Pluribus)

"push off from the shore" of Pirate Lady, across the ocean to the meeting on Air Force One. James Joyce's year 1923 Finn's Hotel... Finnegans Wake recirculations.

Carol Pirate Lady **author**, book writer, song lyrics: "Well, do you ever get the feeling that **the story's too damn real** And in the present tense? Or that **everybody's on the stage** and it seems like you're the **only person** sitting in the audience?"... Hello Carol!

* See also, this Reddit comment from this year is in the same theme of the song lyrics. "I feel like we're all just witnessing one big reverse psychology play unfolding before our eyes in real time." - [June 11, 2025 Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1l8o24w/walmart_faces_maga_boycott_after_heiress_funds_no/mx6b0jm/) (and in contxt to "No Kings" posting of the Reddit comment: Elvis King themes of Air Force One destination suite.)

&nbsp;

## Track 2, Carol: my image of you Pirate Lady!

Carol got her fiction creation, the Pirate Lady, come to life in title of episode 2.

"Villagers - You Lucky One (Official Video)"   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oqOrI8yK-4

Take me back to *the start*, were you always aware?    
Am I getting the gist, am I getting warm?   

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Track 2.5 - Carol: The Hive will do Very Best 

If you let me try, Carol. Hello, Carol! Pirate Lady created for you out of fiction, from out of Africa. Special delivery, Helen Knows!

# Track 3 - the Hive Mind sees 13 every moves

"Daryl Hall & John Oates - Private Eyes (Official HD Video)"   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsntlJZ9h1U

Helen is a spy, but on Carol's side, you see!

Carol don't blow your lines, you blow out the hive mind, you blow the minds of Earth.

Carol does a lot of moves, the butterfy effect. Even if Carol is in private in her house or Air Force One, the billions of people on earth can sense the butterfly effect.

&nbsp;

### Track 3.1 Lunchfast Air Force One

The Air Force One meeting dramatically addreses the hive mind from the top of the stairs (Dandom "Show Biz Kids" of Elvis)... to arrange lunch, to conduct lunch, master to hivemind.

The lunch meeting has metaphors of pre-Twelve gather for Jesus 13. Only 5, partial assembly.

Mr. Robot Open Source, Public Table, gathering of the Free Thinkers about a Future World song:

&nbsp;

### Track 4: Helen is So Happy, She Smiled On Death

&nbsp;

### Track 5: Boozer DUI Wrecking Ball

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My2FRPA3Gf8

Helen gave Carol Finnegans Wake in a "Public House", and started a world war.   
Carol is starting a world war! A call to arms on Air Force One.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Track 5.1: Drown some *UnSung* Joyce man

Singsong memtaphros.    
Give up all I have. Even Air Force One property rights.       
Drown, Pirate Man sent off the plank in Carol's fiction story.   
Pay any prize to rescue the hive mind / humanism.   
I'm looking for that *free ride* to me, you. Pirate spyglass metaphors. Pirates are parasides, ride for free. 

EMBED_TRACK 5.1.1: keyboard metaphors, music keys counting timer countdowns onscreen. Pirate sailing. Images of Carol's Blues. 73 men, San Francisco USA freedom of lexbian sexuality. We Are CALLING EVERYONE to Join the Other Shore of Kepler-22B - Happy Laugh our Lives Away. Nobody voluteered at all.

&nbsp;

### Track 6: Carol can't hear a word Hive Mind Helen says

"David Guetta - Titanium ft. Sia (Official Video)"   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRfuAukYTKg

Hive mind shot down, but it gets up.   
Carol shot down, but she gets up.   
We are at war!   

Carol, it is you who has Further To Fall of mankind, Finnegans Wake. Helen already Fell.

&nbsp;

## Final Track, prep for coming up Episode 3

&nbsp;

"One", Aimee Mann cover    
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3LojyK7PA

&nbsp;

"The Power Of Myth" (nonfiction) year 1988

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Darth Vader has not developed his own humanity. He’s a robot. He’s a bureaucrat, living not in terms of himself but in terms of an imposed system. This is the threat to our lives that we all face today. **Is the system going to flatten you out** and deny you your humanity, or are you going to be able to make use of the system to the attainment of human purposes? How do you relate to the system so that you are not compulsively serving it? It doesn’t help to try to change it to accord with your system of thought. **The momentum of history behind it is too great** for anything really significant to evolve from that kind of action. The thing to do is learn to live in your period of history as a human being. That’s something else, and it can be done.

BILL MOYERS: By doing what?

CAMPBELL: By holding to your own ideals for yourself and, like Luke Skywalker, **rejecting the system’s impersonal claims** upon you.

&nbsp;

## BONUS: Truman Show?

Carl standing in front of Air Force One halting the airplane invokes a Truman Show scene of Truman standing in the middle of the street with his hands halting the hive mind / actors in their cars. Going off-script.

This show opens a lot of Finnegans Wake out-of-band associations to other science fiction media stories. The audience is going wilding on associations.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Meta Metaphors 

Some of my markdown heading titles on this page for Tracks use comma, others use dash, others have none at all. James Joyce Book Title absence voids.
