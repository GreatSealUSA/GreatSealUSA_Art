Helen is a spy, but on Carol's side, you see!

Carol don't blow your lines, you blow out the hive mind, you blow the minds of Earth.

"The Power Of Myth" (nonfiction) year 1988

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Darth Vader has not developed his own humanity. He’s a robot. He’s a bureaucrat, living not in terms of himself but in terms of an imposed system. This is the threat to our lives that we all face today. **Is the system going to flatten you out** and deny you your humanity, or are you going to be able to make use of the system to the attainment of human purposes? How do you relate to the system so that you are not compulsively serving it? It doesn’t help to try to change it to accord with your system of thought. **The momentum of history behind it is too great** for anything really significant to evolve from that kind of action. The thing to do is learn to live in your period of history as a human being. That’s something else, and it can be done.

BILL MOYERS: By doing what?

CAMPBELL: By holding to your own ideals for yourself and, like Luke Skywalker, **rejecting the system’s impersonal claims** upon you.
