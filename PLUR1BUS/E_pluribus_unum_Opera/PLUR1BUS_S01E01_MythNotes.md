# S01E01 Pluribus MythNotes 

* CONTEXT ASSERTION: At minute 22 in Episode One of Apple TV+ Helen drops on the bar the book by James Joyce, "Finn's Hotel" from year 1923. Carol is so mind-blown at minute 23 of Episode One that Carol takes up smoking - two [Torches of Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom) married Eve lesbians lighting up in celebration of Freedom. Like Tim Finnegan, Helen touches the sky of cloud computing on her lit social media device (while Carol is boozed up at the Public House), and falls to crack her head. Carol dead, like Tim Apple.
