* CONTEXT ASSERTION: At minute 22 in Episode One of Apple TV+ show "PLUR1BUS"...Helen drops on the bar the book by James Joyce, "Finn's Hotel" from year 1923. Carol is so mind-blown at minute 23 of Episode One that Carol takes up smoking - two [Torches of Statue of Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom) married Eve lesbians lighting up in celebration of USA (NYC, "*The* Big Apple", "Eve / [Eva *Beware*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl5dkLvtH2c) Big Apple") Lady Freedom. Like Tim Finnegan, Helen touches the sky of cloud computing on her lit social media touch device knowledge system (while Carol is boozed up at the Public House). Helen *Falls*, the woman hits the ground and cracks her head. Carol dead by *Falling*, like Tim Apple.
