https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemez_language#Exclusive_vs._inclusive

The inclusive and exclusive are used to show the relationship between the two speakers, in relation to the topic at hand. The inclusive would put the speaker and his interlocutor, or person being spoken to in the same group, or something that is sometimes known as **"in-group"**. And so conversely if using the exclusive, it shows that they are **an outsider**. An example illustrating this given by Robert Sprott in his **doctoral dissertation** is if there are two men speak Jemez fluently, one a Jemez man and the other a person who is Anglo, but also speaks Jemez. In this case if the man was **talking about a broad subject, like the problems humanity faces, the group would be every human being**, so in this case the inclusive "ʔų́ų́sh" would be used since they both **belong to the same group**. Continuing with this example, if one changes the topic to the problems faced by members pertaining to Native Americans or even more specific, members of just the Jemez nation, then the Jemez man would use "nį́į́sh", because they would no longer be members of the same group.

While it does show the relationship of the speaker to the person being spoken to the, it is not simply used to express an already defined relationships, but can also be used to express changes in this relationship, depending on how the speaker is perceiving or wants the relationship to be perceived by the person who he is speaking to as well as other people. Continuing with the example given by Sprott, if the Jemez man wished to insist that the Anglo was not **an outsider** to the Jemez then he might use the inclusive "ʔų́ų́sh". Also if this man was being taught how to be Jemez, then in that case "ʔų́ų́sh" would carry the additional meaning of an exhortation to meet the expectations held. In this case it shows how the choice in **pronoun can be used to show unity**, and the opposite can also be true. The example given is: “Say I'm on a baseball team and we have a game. One of our good players doesn't show up for the game, but we play without him and we win anyway. Later I run into him and he asks me about the game, “Did we (“ʔų́ų́sh”) win?” I say to him, “Yeah, we (“nį́į́sh”) won,” and that **cuts him out and puts him down**.”

Like the repeat voice mail greetings do cut-out put downs.

* Note at minute 22 Zero Hour of Episode One, baseball seems to be on the Public House television right as the "Breaking News" (Breaking Bad News) about Zero HOur countdown of world change.
* Interstellar 2014 film end of the world baseball. Not eating hot dogs, only eating corn. Great depression / USA dust bowl themes of Great Seal.

Boy, the inception of this wikipedia page to the show is wild. Especially from Minute 22 (Kepler-22 B) of Episode One and Helen's post-doctorate disseration to Carol about Finnegans Wake / James Joyce. The Woke / Wake, USA metaphors. Finn's Hotel housing all the dreams.

OPERA_A The Dreamer's hotel is in very bad shape these days. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJOiQo2ulyw (Wake uou up from R.E.M. end of the world warning alarm bess, Carol singing Rapid Eye Movement sleeping Finnegans)
