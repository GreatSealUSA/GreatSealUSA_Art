Driving and Carol's singing to herself (is it on radio too?)     

R.E.M. song "end of the world", Rapid Eye Movement, dream state. CONTEXT ASSERTION: Minute 22 of Episode One, the post-doctorate book thesis of Helen, James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. Rapid Eye Movement is what Wake / Woke / 1923 Finn's Hotel book is about.

Context Assertion: Finn's Hotel year 1923. Finnegans Wake langauge / thunders.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemez_language#Exclusive_vs._inclusive

The inclusive and exclusive are used to show the relationship between the two speakers, in relation to the topic at hand. The inclusive would put the speaker and his interlocutor, or person being spoken to in the same group, or something that is sometimes known as **"in-group"**. And so conversely if using the exclusive, it shows that they are **an outsider**. An example illustrating this given by Robert Sprott in his **doctoral dissertation** is if there are two men speak Jemez fluently, one a Jemez man and the other a person who is Anglo, but also speaks Jemez. In this case if the man was **talking about a broad subject, like the problems humanity faces, the group would be every human being**, so in this case the inclusive "ʔų́ų́sh" would be used since they both **belong to the same group**. Continuing with this example, if one changes the topic to the problems faced by members pertaining to Native Americans or even more specific, members of just the Jemez nation, then the Jemez man would use "nį́į́sh", because they would no longer be members of the same group.

While it does show the relationship of the speaker to the person being spoken to the, it is not simply used to express an already defined relationships, but can also be used to express changes in this relationship, depending on how the speaker is perceiving or wants the relationship to be perceived by the person who he is speaking to as well as other people. Continuing with the example given by Sprott, if the Jemez man wished to insist that the Anglo was not **an outsider** to the Jemez then he might use the inclusive "ʔų́ų́sh". Also if this man was being taught how to be Jemez, then in that case "ʔų́ų́sh" would carry the additional meaning of an exhortation to meet the expectations held. In this case it shows how the choice in **pronoun can be used to show unity**, and the opposite can also be true. The example given is: “Say I'm on a baseball team and we have a game. One of our good players doesn't show up for the game, but we play without him and we win anyway. Later I run into him and he asks me about the game, “Did we (“ʔų́ų́sh”) win?” I say to him, “Yeah, we (“nį́į́sh”) won,” and that **cuts him out and puts him down**.”

&nbsp;

Like the repeat voice mail greetings do cut-out put downs.

* Note at minute 22 Zero Hour of Episode One, baseball seems to be on the Public House television right as the "Breaking News" (Breaking Bad News) about Zero HOur countdown of world change.
* Interstellar 2014 film end of the world baseball. Not eating hot dogs, only eating corn. Great depression / USA dust bowl themes of Great Seal.

Boy, the inception of this wikipedia page to the show is wild. Especially from Minute 22 (Kepler-22 B) of Episode One and Helen's post-doctorate disseration to Carol about Finnegans Wake / James Joyce. The Woke / Wake, USA metaphors. Finn's Hotel housing all the dreams.

OPERA_A The Dreamer's hotel is in very bad shape these days. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJOiQo2ulyw (Wake uou up from R.E.M. end of the world warning alarm bess, Carol singing Rapid Eye Movement sleeping Finnegans)

# 14:00 Cooking

"Those crazy bastards sure can cook" - Walter White Science cooking / Alton Brown Science metaphors. Brown Maillard metaphors. 

President of the United States Of America, Pluribus. John Adams year 1814: "shortest road to men's hearts is down their throats".

# 16:20 Health Care

It's great to see the show emphasizing the Wikipedia free health care information. Now all medical knowledge is sorted out and clinical trials and self-diagnostic skills for everyone. Symptoms are no longer unknown to people. The technical discussion of water being the cause of headaches, etc.

... Almost a Steely Dan Do It Again replay here, man who gifted water ;)

# 15:00 Player Piano

Any science fiction television series with a player piano and only one *real person* metaphor invokes Westworld Season 1 from HBO. Player piano metaphors for programming minds was huge and established in science fiction USA society.

# Programmed songs into Hive Minds

One Woman standing up to the music programmed into her head. One woman, Nina Paley, standing up to the hive mind in America.

I see Episode Seven making parallels to Elvis music drawing / attracting (with hot women) a person to Vegas / West Gate hotel suite. The hive mind programming of Carol and Koumba Diabaté. Pied piper song metaphors. Themes of Elvis and Carol with the police car, jail-breaking an Apple iPhone / jailbreaking the hive mind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0Rz-uP4Mk

## Television Programming 

It's called programming, hive mind programming.

New York Music Industry Howard Bloom: Billy Joel, Michael Jackson, Styx, Prince. He wrote an entire book about the Pluribus "Hive Mind" in August 2000 - more than 25 years ago.  https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/23539-global-brain-the-evolution-of-mass-mind-from-the-big-bang-to-the-21st-c

* "Howard Bloom (born June 25, 1943) is an American author. He was a music publicist in the 1970s and 1980s for singers and bands such as Prince, Billy Joel, and Styx. He has published a book on Islam, The Muhammad Code, an autobiography, How I Accidentally Started The Sixties, and three books on human evolution and group behavior: The Genius of the Beast, Global Brain, and The Lucifer Principle."

Cool dude! Styx, a great band from Chicago. OPERA_A "The Grand Hive Mind" 1977: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO62scTZ7Qk

&nbsp;

> What does any of that have to do with the songs in the episode

In the hospital scene when she first steals the police car and drives it likes she stole it, the hive mind talks to her through the radio.

The hive mind is programming her / puppeting her brain with media content. Influencing her. She and the Elvis fan are puppets on a string. OPERA_A Kepler-22 B signals like the milk carton seeking, Earth is a puppet https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfm4L0TGDrw&t=173s

# Songs?

Shot the Sherrif Police Car, killed the police car, killed Helen,but did not shoot the spirit of the Dupty Carol.

&nbsp;

In USA culture society, we used to say things like "Far-Out, Man!" But today people go into raging hate in year 2025. They say "WHAT THE FUCK" at you, they blow their mind on #TruthSocial messages from King Trump. **Raging Citizens**. Blow their top over MAGA / ICE / Musk and book quotes.
