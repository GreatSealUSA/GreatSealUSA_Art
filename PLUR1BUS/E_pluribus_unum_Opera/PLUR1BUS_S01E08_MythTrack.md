Opening "We", Pluribus... baby, believe what you individually free will. 

"Somebody must have kicked you around some. Why won't you lay there."

"Baby, we a ain't the first!"

Maybe you were kidnapped, tied away, held for ransom?

Everybody has had to fight to be free.

* What if the fighting is over? Hello Carol!

"DO NOT GIVE UP!"... "WITHOUT A FIGHT"...        

But that **does not mean never give up**. Working Together is part of the Great Seal Free Mason ideals. Democracy requires working together with understanding and comprehension at step 13, and integrity to climb back down from step 13 and be free once more. Ride captain ride, upon your mystery ship, be amazed at the friends you have on your trip down to ground level and drawing board back to step 13!

Ends on "United we Fall" (United States), "Fall of Mankind" / Special Revelations. Great Seal USA Eye above.

The Wall was too high, the wall of the pyramid to step 13.

Carol's worms in back yard of back of Carol's mind.

* March 25 - my Vegas wedding day. And the day Mary is impregnated with Jesus magically from outer-space Eden fertilization RNA / DNA / ??? genetic upgrades ... for the final day Solstice season birth of Episode Nine of PLUR1BUS December 25.

# Track: Carol sleeps to Back  

(Check it out) got yourself a family     
(Check it out) all utility bills have been paid     
You can't tell your best buddy that you love him!    

where does our time go?  (Middle Aged Carol, Eggs expiring)        
(Check it out) got a brand new house in Escrow     
(Check it out) sleeping with your back to your loved one    

This is all that we've learned about happiness?    
forgot to say hello to my neighbors!   
(Check it out) sometimes I question my own behavior...

* American lecture about the entire planet. Sunday, February 28, 1954: "My friends, all I'm trying to say is that if **We are to go forward today**, We've got to go back and rediscover some mighty precious values that *We*'ve left behind. That's the only way that *We* would be able to make of our *world* a better world"!
