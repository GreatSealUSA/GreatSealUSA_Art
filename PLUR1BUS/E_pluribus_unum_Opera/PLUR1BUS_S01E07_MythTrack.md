Album title depits 3 people in the Americas. (We have one in ABQ, one in Vegas, and one heading to ABQ). The title of the album is "Countdown to..." smile faces, happy hive mind behavior. On-screen countdowns abound.

The lyrics discuss driving a car around in Sante Fe, New Mexico. The state where Carol lives, QBQ, the state where the big radio is for the out-space signal, and the state where Carol smokes her poison cigareete at Minute Twenty Two of Episode One for the virgin lungs of hers... and the New Mexico state that is the origins of the atomic bomb (Manhattan project, and the Steely Dan music band is from New York singing a song about New Mexico).

Helo Carol greeting on a ham radio opens the song: "Hello Pluribus", "Hello to One and All"

The man on his departure from the storage unit won't take not bread or help, wont steal better transportation is no theft "highway man", puts cash money to pay for the gasoline he requires.

PARALLEL_ARRAY_CONNECTIONS: Carl Sagan's book and film Contact... uses the same New Mexico Array to receive a short message from deep space. The Contact story opens with a ham radio like our storage unit Radio Shack ham radio.
