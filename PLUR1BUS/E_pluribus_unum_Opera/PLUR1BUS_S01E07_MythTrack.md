Album title depits 3 people in the Americas. (We have one in ABQ, one in Vegas, and one heading to ABQ). The title of the album is "Countdown to..." smile faces, happy hive mind behavior. On-screen countdowns abound.

The lyrics discuss driving a car around in Sante Fe, New Mexico. The state where Carol lives, QBQ, the state where the big radio is for the out-space signal, and the state where Carol smokes her poison cigareete at Minute Twenty Two of Episode One for the virgin lungs of hers... and the New Mexico state that is the origins of the atomic bomb (Manhattan project, and the Steely Dan music band is from New York singing a song about New Mexico).

Helo Carol greeting on a ham radio opens the song: "Hello Pluribus", "Hello to One and All"

The man on his departure from the storage unit won't take not bread or help, wont steal better transportation is no theft "highway man", puts cash money to pay for the gasoline he requires.

PARALLEL_ARRAY_CONNECTIONS: Carl Sagan's book and film Contact... uses the same New Mexico Array to receive a short message from deep space. The Contact story opens with a ham radio like our storage unit Radio Shack ham radio.

Lyrics: "All around me are familar faces" - but they aren't behaving the same, but they are familar like the mayor of ABQ.

Lyrics: Carol finds it hard to tell / communicate with the others because she can't take it.

the murder-suicide loaded bomb drunk bombing at Carol's house was repeated now in Episode Seven alone as a solo suicide. the rocket aimed right at her head against setting her driveway on fire in echos ("Caution! Echoland!") of the explosion from the immigrant murder-suicide Jihadi post September 11, 2001 metaphors.

Dreams of Finengans Wake - **Minute 22 of Episode One in the Public House**. Dreams in which dying / death. Tim Finnegan is **Helen's post-doctorate thesis** at the Zero Hour.

People run in circles. The Great Seal USA circles abound, the outer-space, inner-reaches of the sphere metaphors.

The American Carol jihad bomb of an Africa immigrant, both under Levant religions.

* "There you have the three great Western religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—and because the three of them have three different names for the same biblical god, they can’t get on together. They are stuck with **their metaphor and don’t realize its reference**. They haven’t allowed **the circle that surrounds them to open**."

Carol outdoors launching rockets against the aliens. Impotence. Howls at the moons like a mad dog, drinking and booing into a mental state of dream associations. Like Tim Finnegan drinking, Earwicker's Public House metaphors. The circeling moon / outer space circles in the sky, planets and stars and our moon and sun and our own Earth circles.

* "just as the **moon sheds its shadow**. The serpent sheds its skin to be born again, as the moon its shadow to be born again. They are equivalent symbols. Sometimes the serpent is represented as a **circle eating** its own tail."

Carol's house is on a circle.

* "Just before going out into the garden at the end of the Last Supper, Jesus says to the company, “Let us dance!” And they all **hold hands in a circle, and as they circle** around Him" - 12 + 1 = 13, Great Seal Thirteen, Pluribus
