Man programmed by society hive mind to not take medical care charity. Some callback to Walter White cancer and his wife in Episode 1 of Breaking Bad having credit cards only for emergency use and unforeseen expenses.

The worker goes to computer to generate invoice for the medical services.

So computers still work. And I assume they haven't emptied out public libraries like they did Sprouts grocery store. Can Carol use Internet / is Wikipedia still online? Have all the 13 free thinkers avoided using Internet / social media / Wikipedia - to learn about what actually happened during the alien invasion. As Carol only seems to know the television presentations she was given by the White House and by phone calls and in-person meeting with people.

As an author, Carol hasn't asked for a Wikipedia kind of book / "the story of the RNA discovery".

It is a basic human thing to video / write about / report history. Carol using the video tape to send out messages to others. Carol video taping the milk carton facility.

Information ecology: Is the hive mind information thinking / networking of mind and memory of things (like where Carol hid the spare key to her house) so complete that book storage and computer storage of information are obsolete? Metaphors of someone crating works like video games that never have their source code printed on paper, an entire reliance of storage on digital systems?

### Travel

The taking of the ambulance.

Where does he get his own thinking of this. It is as if films and fiction books he has written or wartime nonfiction books give him the ideas of how to behave in a post-apocalypse situation. He is trying to be self-reliant like a spy or James Bond story he perhaps read for entertainment. It is programmed into him / values / religion and social values of how one should behave under the end of the world.

As a tourist would he never allow a tour bus or airplane pilot? 

The absence of jets in the sky all the time in the show. We have seen the hive drive in convoy to leave ABQ to flee Carol. And the sprouts just in time delivery fleet of an entire retail store. But why do we not witness air travel in the sky - is skill download eliminating the need to move peoples? Or is some huge project going on in India / China / Russia that we can not witness from the scenes we are shown - and only a limited "staff" is in the areas we see.

Carol's police cruising around outskirts of the city to the remote (non suburb) gas station in Episode 7 reveal this lack of traffic / air traffic / highway traffic. The hive mind did not take assets from the gas station yet? ToDo: were their no cold drink bottles and that is why the drone delivery?

Like Walter White self-reliance is a big thing for this man. But there is a type of denial. The Braking Bad sweeper character and how Saul and Walter can't come up with their own escape plans. Only the pro is what they trust. This man in Pluribus doesn't trust any pro.

His distrust of their food is pretty harsh when he is captured at a medical hospital and could have been fed any drugs and such. He really doesn't seem to be thinking that they can easily influence his predictable travel paths and air supply / food supply. He could telephone Carol and use his English book and ask Carol if she is consuming bottles of booze and Gatorade handed over by the hive mind (and she does)

Yes, this is the story being told. The writers get to create this character and tell this story. But I think it is important to study the man's evolution of thinking and if he really thought through this trip after the hospital experience. free will vs. determinism of the injury warnings before he fell into the spiked tree.

My first impression is that the intro title visuals changed. I don't normally give it a lot of attention. But even with my causal concern for it, I seemed to caught it. So I'm capturing my first impression, correct or otherwise.

It moved backwards? from end of word to start of word. And the "p" clearly gave a heartbeat type of signal?

Of course, I can go look at previous episodes and I will.

Return of the American buffalo on native lands.

Carol really seems guilty she took the painting. The whole "it wasn't safe" seems really bullshit, even for Carol. She says she wants to return it, but that the hive mind can't keep historical human art safe? Does this go back to her using the golf club to break skyscraper windows - since the city was evacuated from toxic Carol? Is that building now open to the elements / contents damaged?

First date / second date / third date conversation vibes.

Arranged marriage vibes (I have personal experience of a self-arranged marriage / self-arranged courtship from Africa to Americas like Carol, at middle age like Carol).  The rituals of the drink preparation and serving are very much like north Africa tea serving to me on my first visits to family home as part of self-arranged choice marriage / self-arranged courtship. The long-distance over-Internet metaphors of courtship and marriage in a modern Islamic nation. How consent and "private together" works when dating / engagement. The unspoken presence of classic religion practices and society hive mind / national hive mind / national laws / clergy laws (and state religion / state clergy / Iran and Afghanistan, and women. If this was a homosexual male couple, but even then a man AND woman is more regulated going into private together by clergy than two women - show is highligting a loophole)

Islam is the newest of the classic religions. Year 635 - that is well known to the western world audience. Not counting Salt Lake City Mormons (Vegas), Scientology, etc. But the "classical" ones that empires used (Roman empire: Christianity, Ottoman Empire: Islam).

* "The Ottoman Empire was an Islamic state, officially Sunni Muslim, where the Sultan held the title of Caliph, making him the spiritual and political leader of the Muslim world, controlling Islam's holiest cities (Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem) and integrating Islamic law (Sharia) with state administration, though it also governed diverse non-Muslim populations (Christians, Jews) under a system of religious tolerance (Dhimmi) that granted autonomy but mandated taxes (jizya) and imposed some restrictions, coexisting with secular law (Kanun)."

I think the case could be made that Hollywood music / film / popular books / air traveling musicians (The Beatles, Elvis) could almost be a religion and influence system of say year 1850. And then the Internet + smartphone becoming a world religion-like influence of rituals and customs. Changing how marriages work, how rituals like going to concerts work (live-streaming). 

Prior to air travel, something like a world traveling music band or Olympics competition gathering / FIFA World Cup was very different.

ToDo: want to create a third category? { MythTrack, MythNotes, Inspired Observations ? for each episode }

The Hive mind is watching: This isn't just two people in a room. And "we" is used. 

* Quran, Surah Al-An'am, 6:59. Surah Al-Hadid (57:4): "And He is with you wherever you are. For Allah is All-Seeing of what you do."

And with my marriage, I honestly think the people born into Islam of my family actually believed and behaved this way. Like a "hive mind" knew any secrets and was witnessing it. A lot of mythological / theological experiences are being conveyed in this scene / writing / storytelling of Carol and Zoshia in the sitting room.

I mean, Funeral Wake, Tim Finnegan, mourning period. Helen's wishes and consent, final thoughts as she died, and even perhaps her mind being simulated in other minds for new thoughts. Helen is in the back yard in back of Carol's "old world' conventions. Even in modern ABQ, a grave in one's own yard tends to be something only wealthy like Donald Trump does with golf course "yard" burial of a spouse. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/31/donald-ivana-trump-cemetery-golf-course-taxes 

Native Americans are heavily influenced by ancestors. Trying to do the WWJD (What Would Jesus Do?) pondering. What would Helen do / want? A lost spouse and re-marriage, people do make pledges to marry / not remarry. Not an uncommon trope in storytelling. Pre-nuptial spiritual agreements outside concerns of money, such as parenting and re-marriage wishes (in some Islamic nations, enforceable by police / the law). 

OPERA_A the entire film from Iran "A Separation" year 2012 and Roger Ebert's Chicago USA perspective. I saw the film in Austin, Texas cinema based on Ebert's review. https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-separation-2012 It has a pretty big impact on my life with my personal Islam marriage and modern times of legal licensing and divorce and hive mind of the law / hive mind of the clergy / shared mindset of a marriage and families / hive mind of written and spoken languages within families.
