The worker goes to computer to generate invoice for the medical services.

So computers still work. And I assume they haven't emptied out public libraries like they did Sprouts grocery store. Can Carol use Internet / is Wikipedia still online? Have all the 13 free thinkers avoided using Internet / social media / Wikipedia - to learn about what actually happened during the alien invasion. As Carol only seems to know the television presentations she was given by the White House and by phone calls and in-person meeting with people.

As an author, Carol hasn't asked for a Wikipedia kind of book / "the story of the RNA discovery".

It is a basic human thing to video / write about / report history. Carol using the video tape to send out messages to others. Carol video taping the milk carton facility.

Information ecology: Is the hive mind information thinking / networking of mind and memory of things (like where Carol hid the spare key to her house) so complete that book storage and computer storage of information are obsolete? Metaphors of someone crating works like video games that never have their source code printed on paper, an entire reliance of storage on digital systems?
