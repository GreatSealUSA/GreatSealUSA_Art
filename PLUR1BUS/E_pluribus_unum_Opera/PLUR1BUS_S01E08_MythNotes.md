Man programmed by society hive mind to not take medical care charity. Some callback to Walter White cancer and his wife in Episode 1 of Breaking Bad having credit cards only for emergency use and unforeseen expenses.

# 00:02 30 seconds

The worker goes to computer to generate invoice for the medical services.

So computers still work. And I assume they haven't emptied out public libraries like they did Sprouts grocery store. Can Carol use Internet / is Wikipedia still online? Have all the 13 free thinkers avoided using Internet / social media / Wikipedia - to learn about what actually happened during the alien invasion. As Carol only seems to know the television presentations she was given by the White House and by phone calls and in-person meeting with people.

As an author, Carol hasn't asked for a Wikipedia kind of book / "the story of the RNA discovery".

It is a basic human thing to video / write about / report history. Carol using the video tape to send out messages to others. Carol video taping the milk carton facility.

Information ecology: Is the hive mind information thinking / networking of mind and memory of things (like where Carol hid the spare key to her house) so complete that book storage and computer storage of information are obsolete? Metaphors of someone crating works like video games that never have their source code printed on paper, an entire reliance of storage on digital systems?

### Travel

The taking of the ambulance.

Where does he get his own thinking of this. It is as if films and fiction books he has written or wartime nonfiction books give him the ideas of how to behave in a post-apocalypse situation. He is trying to be self-reliant like a spy or James Bond story he perhaps read for entertainment. It is programmed into him / values / religion and social values of how one should behave under the end of the world.

As a tourist would he never allow a tour bus or airplane pilot? 

The absence of jets in the sky all the time in the show. We have seen the hive drive in convoy to leave ABQ to flee Carol. And the sprouts just in time delivery fleet of an entire retail store. But why do we not witness air travel in the sky - is skill download eliminating the need to move peoples? Or is some huge project going on in India / China / Russia that we can not witness from the scenes we are shown - and only a limited "staff" is in the areas we see.

Carol's police cruising around outskirts of the city to the remote (non suburb) gas station in Episode 7 reveal this lack of traffic / air traffic / highway traffic. The hive mind did not take assets from the gas station yet? ToDo: were their no cold drink bottles and that is why the drone delivery?

Like Walter White self-reliance is a big thing for this man. But there is a type of denial. The Braking Bad sweeper character and how Saul and Walter can't come up with their own escape plans. Only the pro is what they trust. This man in Pluribus doesn't trust any pro.

His distrust of their food is pretty harsh when he is captured at a medical hospital and could have been fed any drugs and such. He really doesn't seem to be thinking that they can easily influence his predictable travel paths and air supply / food supply. He could telephone Carol and use his English book and ask Carol if she is consuming bottles of booze and Gatorade handed over by the hive mind (and she does)

Yes, this is the story being told. The writers get to create this character and tell this story. But I think it is important to study the man's evolution of thinking and if he really thought through this trip after the hospital experience. free will vs. determinism of the injury warnings before he fell into the spiked tree.

# 03:00  

My first impression is that the intro title visuals changed. I don't normally give it a lot of attention. But even with my causal concern for it, I seemed to caught it. So I'm capturing my first impression, correct or otherwise.

It moved backwards? from end of word to start of word. And the "p" clearly gave a heartbeat type of signal?

Of course, I can go look at previous episodes and I will.

# 04:00  

Return of the American buffalo on native lands.

Carol really seems guilty she took the painting. The whole "it wasn't safe" seems really bullshit, even for Carol. She says she wants to return it, but that the hive mind can't keep historical human art safe? Does this go back to her using the golf club to break skyscraper windows - since the city was evacuated from toxic Carol? Is that building now open to the elements / contents damaged? 

# 06:00 

First date / second date / third date conversation vibes.

Arranged marriage vibes (I have personal experience of a self-arranged marriage / self-arranged courtship from Africa to Americas like Carol, at middle age like Carol).  The rituals of the drink preparation and serving are very much like north Africa tea serving to me on my first visits to family home as part of self-arranged choice marriage / self-arranged courtship. The long-distance over-Internet metaphors of courtship and marriage in a modern Islamic nation. How consent and "private together" works when dating / engagement. The unspoken presence of classic religion practices and society hive mind / national hive mind / national laws / clergy laws (and state religion / state clergy / Iran and Afghanistan, and women. If this was a homosexual male couple, but even then a man AND woman is more regulated going into private together by clergy than two women - show is highligting a loophole)

Islam is the newest of the classic religions. Year 635 - that is well known to the western world audience. Not counting Salt Lake City Mormons (Vegas), Scientology, etc. But the "classical" ones that empires used (Roman empire: Christianity, Ottoman Empire: Islam).

* "The Ottoman Empire was an Islamic state, officially Sunni Muslim, where the Sultan held the title of Caliph, making him the spiritual and political leader of the Muslim world, controlling Islam's holiest cities (Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem) and integrating Islamic law (Sharia) with state administration, though it also governed diverse non-Muslim populations (Christians, Jews) under a system of religious tolerance (Dhimmi) that granted autonomy but mandated taxes (jizya) and imposed some restrictions, coexisting with secular law (Kanun)."

I think the case could be made that Hollywood music / film / popular books / air traveling musicians (The Beatles, Elvis) could almost be a religion and influence system of say year 1850. And then the Internet + smartphone becoming a world religion-like influence of rituals and customs. Changing how marriages work, how rituals like going to concerts work (live-streaming). 

Prior to air travel, something like a world traveling music band or Olympics competition gathering / FIFA World Cup was very different.

ToDo: want to create a third category? { MythTrack, MythNotes, Inspired Observations ? for each episode }

The Hive mind is watching: This isn't just two people in a room. And "we" is used. 

* Quran, Surah Al-An'am, 6:59. Surah Al-Hadid (57:4): "And He is with you wherever you are. For Allah is All-Seeing of what you do."

And with my marriage, I honestly think the people born into Islam of my family actually believed and behaved this way. Like a "hive mind" knew any secrets and was witnessing it. A lot of mythological / theological experiences are being conveyed in this scene / writing / storytelling of Carol and Zoshia in the sitting room.

I mean, Funeral Wake, Tim Finnegan, mourning period. Helen's wishes and consent, final thoughts as she died, and even perhaps her mind being simulated in other minds for new thoughts. Helen is in the back yard in back of Carol's "old world' conventions. Even in modern ABQ, a grave in one's own yard tends to be something only wealthy like Donald Trump does with golf course "yard" burial of a spouse. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/31/donald-ivana-trump-cemetery-golf-course-taxes 

Native Americans are heavily influenced by ancestors. Trying to do the WWJD (What Would Jesus Do?) pondering. What would Helen do / want? A lost spouse and re-marriage, people do make pledges to marry / not remarry. Not an uncommon trope in storytelling. Pre-nuptial spiritual agreements outside concerns of money, such as parenting and re-marriage wishes (in some Islamic nations, enforceable by police / the law). 

OPERA_A the entire film from Iran "A Separation" year 2012 and Roger Ebert's Chicago USA perspective. I saw the film in Austin, Texas cinema based on Ebert's review. https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-separation-2012 It has a pretty big impact on my life with my personal Islam marriage and modern times of legal licensing and divorce and hive mind of the law / hive mind of the clergy / shared mindset of a marriage and families / hive mind of written and spoken languages within families.

Very Joycean / Authoring word-choice of *The Wake* ("lifting the veil") year 1923 and hybrid-metaphors hybrid-warfare of Joycean vs. Romans 11:32 Clergy: { Boredom games / flat board games / board room meeting Air Force One strategy to defeat the hive mind games / biological imperative last encounter in the house dialog - sexual tension biological imperative two-way exploitation semi-arranged semi-consensual hookup / peering exploitation and mind games  } OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVYXWVs0Prc Lifting the Veil, some call it love-magic (Stephan A. H. lecture 1987)

Board games / we don't have to talk / boredom games. Low technology / previous generation of technology media ecology (industrial revolution, mass produced interchangeable game parts). 

All knowing hive-mind that produces and teaches these games. 

Little misdirection details. how hard is it to grab a household object to replace the missing chess piece. OPERA_A I'm your queen, or are you working for the white queen? Starship Kepler-22B troopers. All good behaved Hive Mind People turning their heads towards the 13 free thinkers. The Hive Mind wants to make you wise.

# 00:07 30 seconds cousins 

The first mention of Carol's family outside the abusive sending her to Lesbian interment Christian camp at age 16? Am I forgetting others?

MIXING_BOARD Joyce Finn's Hotel bedding themes: { Incest, kissing cousins, family planning, eggs on ice, stem sells, stimulating stems, seduction, privacy of the sex act from aliens film "Colossus: The Forbin Project" or super-intelligence watching, second-cousin or third-cousin or metaphors of religion that we are all *sisters and brothers* such as Bible verse "1 John 3:17" hive mind shared property, Adam Eve paradox and who does the child have sex with when starting from 2 people maths?, physical body vs. light inside }

* "power and begins to decline, is to identify yourself not with the body, which is falling away, but with the consciousness of which it is a vehicle. This is something I learned from myths. What am I? Am I the bulb that carries the light, or am I the light of which the bulb is a vehicle?" - Skywalker Ranch Metaphors Universe for SciFi audiences


Returning to the card game themes of Veges "opening hands". OPERA_A Repeat until Bloomsday, then repeat even harder, and iterate always. Mankind vs. Mankind (eyeglasses Gaga wears: "POP CULTURE") bluffing with biological heart and muffin, getting each other *high*. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bESGLojNYSo Can't read Carol's *wall facer* mind of unpublished works.

# 00:08 Christmas year 2005

Show ends on Christmas day, themes building up. 2005 to 2025 echos. "Caution! Echoland!"

Magical stem cell virgin Mary metaphors abound. Lesbians producing stem cells. RNA invasion from Eden metaphors abound.

Cousin Henry. 

* "Cousin Henry is an 1879 novel by Anthony Trollope about the inheritance of a Welsh estate, Llanfeare, and the moral dilemma of its indecisive owner, Indefer Jones, who wants to leave it to his niece Isabel but feels bound by tradition to name a male heir, his nephew Henry. The plot centers on the conflict between duty and desire, as the weak-willed Henry discovers a new will that names Isabel as heir, forcing him to choose between his own gain and her security. It is considered one of Trollope's more experimental and psychologically focused shorter novels, exploring themes of family, class, and personal integrity"

Well strong-willed Carol and the protector of human inheritance being locked up from roaming animals.

ASSERTION: Show opens with a book author married to a book publisher on a book tour at a book store. Who scheme to arrange books at the book store of an airport facing the public. Pirating books, mixing of languages, mixing of "plucking fruit" if starving Tree of Knowledge metaphors abound. 

Plucking on the strings of Minute 22 Episode One post-doc thesis of Helen at the Zero Hour, Kepller 22 minutes into Episode One iterations and recursions. "Finnegans Wake Mash-up: Joyce created a "brilliant mash-up" by mixing real life with Trollope's fictional Barsetshire, blurring boundaries between his characters and Trollope's, notes The Trollope Jupiter, demonstrating Joyce's playful engagement with his literary predecessor." - https://thetrollopejupiter.wordpress.com/tag/anthony-trollope/

Reminder:  "Caution! Echoland!" OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM8QJAlHlR4 "People with Accents"

ToDo: I'm sure someone has mapped out episodes to stages of grief. Free 13 grief for humanity "old world order". Do some searching.

# 00:08 20 seconds Exactly Like 

Now, now, now, I think audiences on virgin viewing of the first showing are REALLY misusing the point here.

Is sex with a fat person vs. thin person the same? The buy in Vegas doesn't think so. Sex with a age 19  body the same as sex with an age 59 body the same? Tall / short. Do the voices sound the same? Does the hair smell the same? 

Does an onion in near by Hatch **New Mexico** taste the same as one grown in Grabill, Indiana? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grabill,_Indiana (I've been to Hatch for the festival. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch,_New_Mexico#Economy my first Wife Tristan (Finnegans Wake 1923 character on page 3 with deep roots in choice marriage ideals) grew up in Ruidoso. 

* Onions or peppers or tomatoes, [*oh my!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-JJuHpfN5g), I was born in Georgia, we have our New Mexico Hatch concerns. I've lived in Washington too, and tasted the onion fruits. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidalia_onion ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walla_Walla,_Washington#Agriculture OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdRnMjfVQi0



Kissing a human sweaty, dirty, smelly (Episode Two, Africa departure) is nothing at all like a showered perfumed experience. 

I've seen not a thing that says the hive mind members can duplicate vocal talents and vocal skills

And that's the fucking point of Finnegans Wake. It is to be ORAL SPOKEN. Aloud, out loud. University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan - Joycean extraordinaire (and his children too) in black and white television to the general public on *out loud*. https://youtube.com/watch?v=-f2F02gsYsk to get the full dose, not no micro-dose, of Joyce! Helen's post-doctorate thesis to Helen is - you may have done Heroine Carol, but I did LSD Joyce trips to prepare me for this day, the Zero Hour over Walter White's grave site Public House! Has ANYONE HERE forgotten that the last time Carol was with this woman she dosed her with drugs, forced, non-consenting? Dialog intercourse here, folks, Intercourse is dosing. WATCH AGAIN https://youtube.com/watch?v=-f2F02gsYsk

Do it again. OPERA_A Carol is digging water wells and chasing waterfalls because Helen Fell like Tim. In the morning, you go board game gunning, for the woman who stole your water. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmdiKePVUy8

(Is there really a minus-sign at the start of that video ID on YouTube, haven't noticed all the years I had that up on www.LazyWake.com )

If you think the hug of a person, the smell of a person, the voice of a person, The Matrix 199 confrontation of the hive mind https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL9Y24ciNWs "This Reality" - is not significant. If you think 13 people talking in a room at once is same as 1 when dealing with the hive mind dialog (Airport scene before Air Force One arrives in Episode Two, the family members and who was speaking)....

* "Shakespeare said that art is a mirror held up to nature. And that’s what it is. The nature is your nature, and all of these wonderful poetic images of mythology are referring to something in you. When your mind is simply trapped by the image out there so that you never make the reference to yourself, you have misread the image." - Skywalker Gaucho Lessons

Lick your touch device screen Apple //+ keyboard TV show when Pluribus depicts food. 

* Wake Up Finnegans! "A metaphor is an image that suggests something else. For instance, if I say to a person, “You are a nut,” I’m not suggesting that I think the person is literally a nut. “Nut” is a metaphor. The reference of the metaphor in religious traditions is to something transcendent that is not literally any thing. If you think that the metaphor is itself the reference, it would be like going to a restaurant, asking for the menu, seeing beefsteak written there, and starting to eat the menu. For example, Jesus ascended to heaven. The denotation would seem to be that somebody ascended to the sky. That’s literally what is being said. But if that were really the meaning of the message, then we have to throw it away" - Easter Lessons from Skywalker Ranch, California in the middle 1980's
