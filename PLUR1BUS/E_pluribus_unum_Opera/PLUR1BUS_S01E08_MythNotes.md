First time watching overvaluations, pausing and nothing. I'm watching alone.

# 00:00 30 seconds

Man programmed by society hive mind to not take medical care charity. Some callback to Walter White cancer and his wife in Episode 1 of Breaking Bad having credit cards only for emergency use and unforeseen expenses.

# 00:02 30 seconds

The worker goes to computer to generate invoice for the medical services.

So computers still work. And I assume they haven't emptied out public libraries like they did Sprouts grocery store. Can Carol use Internet / is Wikipedia still online? Have all the 13 free thinkers avoided using Internet / social media / Wikipedia - to learn about what actually happened during the alien invasion. As Carol only seems to know the television presentations she was given by the White House and by phone calls and in-person meeting with people.

As an author, Carol hasn't asked for a Wikipedia kind of book / "the story of the RNA discovery".

It is a basic human thing to video / write about / report history. Carol using the video tape to send out messages to others. Carol video taping the milk carton facility.

Information ecology: Is the hive mind information thinking / networking of mind and memory of things (like where Carol hid the spare key to her house) so complete that book storage and computer storage of information are obsolete? Metaphors of someone crating works like video games that never have their source code printed on paper, an entire reliance of storage on digital systems?

### Travel

The taking of the ambulance.

Where does he get his own thinking of this. It is as if films and fiction books he has written or wartime nonfiction books give him the ideas of how to behave in a post-apocalypse situation. He is trying to be self-reliant like a spy or James Bond story he perhaps read for entertainment. It is programmed into him / values / religion and social values of how one should behave under the end of the world.

As a tourist would he never allow a tour bus or airplane pilot? 

The absence of jets in the sky all the time in the show. We have seen the hive drive in convoy to leave ABQ to flee Carol. And the sprouts just in time delivery fleet of an entire retail store. But why do we not witness air travel in the sky - is skill download eliminating the need to move peoples? Or is some huge project going on in India / China / Russia that we can not witness from the scenes we are shown - and only a limited "staff" is in the areas we see.

Carol's police cruising around outskirts of the city to the remote (non suburb) gas station in Episode 7 reveal this lack of traffic / air traffic / highway traffic. The hive mind did not take assets from the gas station yet? ToDo: were their no cold drink bottles and that is why the drone delivery?

Like Walter White self-reliance is a big thing for this man. But there is a type of denial. The Braking Bad sweeper character and how Saul and Walter can't come up with their own escape plans. Only the pro is what they trust. This man in Pluribus doesn't trust any pro.

His distrust of their food is pretty harsh when he is captured at a medical hospital and could have been fed any drugs and such. He really doesn't seem to be thinking that they can easily influence his predictable travel paths and air supply / food supply. He could telephone Carol and use his English book and ask Carol if she is consuming bottles of booze and Gatorade handed over by the hive mind (and she does)

Yes, this is the story being told. The writers get to create this character and tell this story. But I think it is important to study the man's evolution of thinking and if he really thought through this trip after the hospital experience. free will vs. determinism of the injury warnings before he fell into the spiked tree.

# 03:00  

My first impression is that the intro title visuals changed. I don't normally give it a lot of attention. But even with my causal concern for it, I seemed to caught it. So I'm capturing my first impression, correct or otherwise.

It moved backwards? from end of word to start of word. And the "p" clearly gave a heartbeat type of signal?

Of course, I can go look at previous episodes and I will.

# 04:00  

Return of the American buffalo on native lands.

Carol really seems guilty she took the painting. The whole "it wasn't safe" seems really bullshit, even for Carol. She says she wants to return it, but that the hive mind can't keep historical human art safe? Does this go back to her using the golf club to break skyscraper windows - since the city was evacuated from toxic Carol? Is that building now open to the elements / contents damaged? 

# 06:00 

First date / second date / third date conversation vibes.

Arranged marriage vibes (I have personal experience of a self-arranged marriage / self-arranged courtship from Africa to Americas like Carol, at middle age like Carol).  The rituals of the drink preparation and serving are very much like north Africa tea serving to me on my first visits to family home as part of self-arranged choice marriage / self-arranged courtship. The long-distance over-Internet metaphors of courtship and marriage in a modern Islamic nation. How consent and "private together" works when dating / engagement. The unspoken presence of classic religion practices and society hive mind / national hive mind / national laws / clergy laws (and state religion / state clergy / Iran and Afghanistan, and women. If this was a homosexual male couple, but even then a man AND woman is more regulated going into private together by clergy than two women - show is highligting a loophole)

Islam is the newest of the classic religions. Year 635 - that is well known to the western world audience. Not counting Salt Lake City Mormons (Vegas), Scientology, etc. But the "classical" ones that empires used (Roman empire: Christianity, Ottoman Empire: Islam).

* "The Ottoman Empire was an Islamic state, officially Sunni Muslim, where the Sultan held the title of Caliph, making him the spiritual and political leader of the Muslim world, controlling Islam's holiest cities (Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem) and integrating Islamic law (Sharia) with state administration, though it also governed diverse non-Muslim populations (Christians, Jews) under a system of religious tolerance (Dhimmi) that granted autonomy but mandated taxes (jizya) and imposed some restrictions, coexisting with secular law (Kanun)."

I think the case could be made that Hollywood music / film / popular books / air traveling musicians (The Beatles, Elvis) could almost be a religion and influence system of say year 1850. And then the Internet + smartphone becoming a world religion-like influence of rituals and customs. Changing how marriages work, how rituals like going to concerts work (live-streaming). 

Prior to air travel, something like a world traveling music band or Olympics competition gathering / FIFA World Cup was very different.

ToDo: want to create a third category? { MythTrack, MythNotes, Inspired Observations ? for each episode }

The Hive mind is watching: This isn't just two people in a room. And "we" is used. 

* Quran, Surah Al-An'am, 6:59. Surah Al-Hadid (57:4): "And He is with you wherever you are. For Allah is All-Seeing of what you do."

And with my marriage, I honestly think the people born into Islam of my family actually believed and behaved this way. Like a "hive mind" knew any secrets and was witnessing it. A lot of mythological / theological experiences are being conveyed in this scene / writing / storytelling of Carol and Zoshia in the sitting room.

I mean, Funeral Wake, Tim Finnegan, mourning period. Helen's wishes and consent, final thoughts as she died, and even perhaps her mind being simulated in other minds for new thoughts. Helen is in the back yard in back of Carol's "old world' conventions. Even in modern ABQ, a grave in one's own yard tends to be something only wealthy like Donald Trump does with golf course "yard" burial of a spouse. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/31/donald-ivana-trump-cemetery-golf-course-taxes 

Native Americans are heavily influenced by ancestors. Trying to do the WWJD (What Would Jesus Do?) pondering. What would Helen do / want? A lost spouse and re-marriage, people do make pledges to marry / not remarry. Not an uncommon trope in storytelling. Pre-nuptial spiritual agreements outside concerns of money, such as parenting and re-marriage wishes (in some Islamic nations, enforceable by police / the law). 

OPERA_A the entire film from Iran "A Separation" year 2012 and Roger Ebert's Chicago USA perspective. I saw the film in Austin, Texas cinema based on Ebert's review. https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-separation-2012 It has a pretty big impact on my life with my personal Islam marriage and modern times of legal licensing and divorce and hive mind of the law / hive mind of the clergy / shared mindset of a marriage and families / hive mind of written and spoken languages within families.

# 00:08 Christmas year 2005

Show ends on Christmas day, themes building up. 2005 to 2025 echos. "Caution! Echoland!"

Magical stem cell virgin Mary metaphors abound. Lesbians producing stem cells. RNA invasion from Eden metaphors abound.

Cousin Henry. 

* "Cousin Henry is an 1879 novel by Anthony Trollope about the inheritance of a Welsh estate, Llanfeare, and the moral dilemma of its indecisive owner, Indefer Jones, who wants to leave it to his niece Isabel but feels bound by tradition to name a male heir, his nephew Henry. The plot centers on the conflict between duty and desire, as the weak-willed Henry discovers a new will that names Isabel as heir, forcing him to choose between his own gain and her security. It is considered one of Trollope's more experimental and psychologically focused shorter novels, exploring themes of family, class, and personal integrity"

Well strong-willed Carol and the protector of human inheritance being locked up from roaming animals.

ASSERTION: Show opens with a book author married to a book publisher on a book tour at a book store. Who scheme to arrange books at the book store of an airport facing the public. Pirating books, mixing of languages, mixing of "plucking fruit" if starving Tree of Knowledge metaphors abound. 

Plucking on the strings of Minute 22 Episode One post-doc thesis of Helen at the Zero Hour, Kepller 22 minutes into Episode One iterations and recursions. "Finnegans Wake Mash-up: Joyce created a "brilliant mash-up" by mixing real life with Trollope's fictional Barsetshire, blurring boundaries between his characters and Trollope's, notes The Trollope Jupiter, demonstrating Joyce's playful engagement with his literary predecessor." - https://thetrollopejupiter.wordpress.com/tag/anthony-trollope/

I mean, I don’t need to use examples, just visit Los Angeles. Just walk down the walk of stars at one o’clock in the morning, and ask yourself “Are these people really here, or is this central casting?” And *it isn’t a funny question*.

Now, now, now, I think audiences on virgin viewing of the first showing are REALLY misusing the point here.

Is sex with a fat person vs. thin person the same? The buy in Vegas doesn't think so. Sex with a age 19  body the same as sex with an age 59 body the same? Tall / short. Do the voices sound the same? Does the hair smell the same?

If you think 13 people talking in a room at once is same as 1 when dealing with the hive mind dialog (Airport scene before Air Force One arrives in Episode Two, the family members and who was speaking)....

* "Shakespeare said that art is a mirror held up to nature. And that’s what it is. The nature is your nature, and all of these wonderful poetic images of mythology are referring to something in you. When your mind is simply trapped by the image out there so that you never make the reference to yourself, you have misread the image." - Skywalker Gaucho Lessons

Lick your touch device screen Apple //+ keyboard TV show when Pluribus depicts food. 

* Wake Up Finnegans! "A metaphor is an image that suggests something else. For instance, if I say to a person, “You are a nut,” I’m not suggesting that I think the person is literally a nut. “Nut” is a metaphor. The reference of the metaphor in religious traditions is to something transcendent that is not literally any thing. If you think that the metaphor is itself the reference, it would be like going to a restaurant, asking for the menu, seeing beefsteak written there, and starting to eat the menu. For example, Jesus ascended to heaven. The denotation would seem to be that somebody ascended to the sky. That’s literally what is being said. But if that were really the meaning of the message, then we have to throw it away" - Easter Lessons from Skywalker Ranch, California in the middle 1980's

1. Never eaten an egg before. Minute 22 Helen's post-doctorate thesis. Finn's Hotel year 1923. https://youtu.be/squl14tighM?t=1383 something fundamental in Carol has changed. Pirate Lady mind games forever, earlier in the day she was manipulated over a meal, fast breaking after boozing nights. Grace O'Malley (Gráinne Ní Mháille) and Molly Malone - Pirate Ladies of Love / Chemical Romance Bloomy days.

2. Second coming of RNA to impregnate ice eggs on December 25 episode. https://youtu.be/squl14tighM?t=1535 - the viral repeater stations of K-22B / Minute 22 countdown / screen countdowns / Episode One Zero Hour. The orgasm second of fertility of stem cells.

3. The Hive mind says the dog is not part of the hive mind directed (ToDo: confirm). A lot of things audience are not grasping with all the very early Episode one theories about the big antenna project is that life on Earth is being restored by the hive mind. Animals can still kill animals, predatory. 12 Monkeys (mono-myth keys / Finn's Hotel Key book) SciFi film (Bruce Willis / docroate of psychology mass mind monomyth hive interactions) depicts animals returned. Ending the selfish gene / egomania / egoism isn't killing life on Earth. It's fixing The Matrix 1999 SciFi metaphors of humanity as a virus that won't seek equilibrium with environment. Of course, the countup countdown emphasizes that there is *plenty of time*. The slow journey from the man crossing from immigrant Rio Grande riverrum also emphasizes the time passage. The hive mind is treating Carol as a super super super super God above all else - the 13 play a key key key role in shaping the hive mind. Movement and shaking the hive mind in and out of ABQ. And the history of her book fandom is very real, Helen is leading and publicizing the book inside the hive mind.

"Literary Usage: The word appears as "unregendered" in James Joyce's experimental novel Finnegans Wake, a work known for its complex wordplay and invented words. In that specific context, it is used with "ungendered" in a passage related to fluid identity and the merging of male and female forms, making its meaning specific to the book's themes."

# Trains / Training / Conducting 

<img width="2402" height="1502" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af13250d-9f36-407e-b7e5-d075aef6ccce" />

What Google Search users will encounter, 2025-12-20 afternoon USA    

Trains in Finnegans Wake aren't just transportation; they symbolize history, communication, the flow of time, and Dublin's geography, appearing as literal Dublin train stations (like Howth, Bray) and metaphorical "thunderclaps" of technological change, especially the railroad, woven into Joyce's complex, dreamlike language that echoes train sounds and rhythms. The book's cyclical nature mirrors train journeys, with its famous opening lines about Howth Head setting a "commodious vicus of recirculation," a circular path back to itself. 

Key Roles of Trains in the Wake:

* Dublin Geography: Specific DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) stations along the coast (Blackrock, Dalkey, Howth) are named, grounding the fantastical narrative in real locations.
* The "Thunderclap" of Technology: Trains represent one of Joyce's major communication revolutions, encoding cultural shifts, similar to print, radio, and TV, creating "thunderclaps" of sound and meaning.
* Cyclical Time & Recirculation: The constant movement and repetition of trains embody the novel's cyclical structure, the "riverrun" of history and consciousness.
* Sound & Language: Train sounds (whistles, clatter) are integrated into Joyce's portmanteau words, creating a unique linguistic experience that mimics the dream state.

# Episode 8 Title: Snake Charming

Eden snake and the Apple-Plucking (will only eat *the fallen* on Earth / Eden). The NO PLUCK only rule of Eden.

Eden perfection. Charming the snake in the Garden. The wild animals of New Mexico hiking in the rocky areas with Carol the train scene. Wildlife encroaching on suburbs. OPERA_A Deacon blues: this brother is free snaking through the suburbs. Steely Dan Godwhackers metaphors of Deacon Church.

Charming the god-like power of the hive mind with booze in Carol's house, earlier with explosive Jihadi tricks that sent Pirate Lady to the hospital, now in Episode 8 Charming with the snake against the super ego / mass mind executive function exploits through the pelvic birth entrance. 

* "On the third morning, the wife is glorious, and Gawain, a young man about to meet his death, has all he can do to keep his head and retain his knightly honor, with this last gift before him of the luxury of life. This time, he accepts three kisses. And when she has delivered these, she begs him, as a token of her love, to accept her garter. “It is charmed,” she says, “and will protect you against every danger.” So Gawain accepts the garter."

* New Mexico. "won’t tell you what **makes you happy**, but it will tell you what happens when you begin to **follow your happiness**, what the obstacles are that you’re going to run into. For example, there’s a motif in **American Indian stories** that I call “the refusal of suitors.” There’s a young girl, **beautiful, charming**, and the young men invite her to marriage. “No, no, no,” she says, “there’s nobody around good enough for me.” So **a serpent comes**, or, if it’s a boy who won’t have anything to do with girls, the **serpent queen of a great lake** might come. As soon as you have refused the suitors, you have elevated yourself out of the local field and put yourself in the field of higher power, higher danger. The question is, are you going to be able to handle it?"

  * the *serpent queen of a great lake* - Pirate Lady / Pirate Queen. Helen's **post-doctorate thesis**. ... ... ... *"Pirate Queen" in Finnegans Wake refers to the legendary Irish sea captain Grace O'Malley (Gráinne Mhaol), whom James Joyce incorporates as the Prankquean, a pivotal, riddle-posing female figure*

ToDo: why is a Polish little girl grown up in northern Africa in local dress? Maybe some hints or research on what other people have picked up. https://old.reddit.com/r/AcademicQuran/comments/132fhu2/does_islamic_law_have_any_requirements_for/ Qur'an 3:45-47, 19:16-21 { لَمْ يَمْسَسْنِي  , lesbians, بَشَرٌ } - I think Carol bedding with the hive mind has been consent for them to take the eggs in their "left behind" fallen off the fruit tree (her body) logic. But the magic potion of James Joyce, water of life, is the Tristan and Isolde potion to get past the Middle Ages censors - the "love potion" to bypass Church sensors with the year 1210 troubadours of Isolde and Tristan / King Mark story.
