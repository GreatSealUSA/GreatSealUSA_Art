Stab at a summary of Finnegans Wake intro in the story of Pluribus.

I encourage everyone to look at one track of study if they have the time. "Media Ecology". We are dealing with extremely experienced actors and writers who are considered by many to be the best fiction television content creators of all time. The show opens with "audience within a play", "play within a play".  A marriage of **a book publisher and a book author**. The show creators have also stressed in interviews key things about inspiring society towards goodness.  February 16, 2025 USA Today story way ahead of the show premier: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/02/16/breaking-bad-creator-vince-gilligan-bad-guys/78856929007/

Carol's last name taken from Twilight Zone 1960 episode, the ties to X Files  1995 television episode writing.  Vince Gilligan has outright stated the **mythology / myth** of an entire generation of people / society is his focus: https://youtu.be/kFrffEktluo?t=3315

&nbsp;

That said... so my focus on media ecology is the root of all modern media ecology. James Joyce's book [Finnegans Wake that started streaming release in year 1924](https://jamesjoyce.ie/events/mamalujo-finnegans-wake-as-a-work-in-progress/). And was finished publication on Star Wars Force Day, 1939! (May 4, 1939)

1. "Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan (University of Toronto), Newsweek Magazine, page 56, February 28, 1966

2. At 23 minutes into Episode One of Pluribus, you will see Helen drop Finnegans Wake on the bar in a Public House. This is the setting of James Joyce's book.

3. Helen emphasizes it was *graduate study* for her. She also proclaims that if a fiction story makes even **one single person happy** it is in a category of art. And clearly we see the themes of smiling Petri dishes / happy throughout the show.

4. In the parking lot outside the Public House... Helen touches the social media device. Flame comes out, smoking hot topic. Helen touches on the most touchy topic in USA society: trans-gender of the "Lady Pirate" fiction character. This would be like Harry Potter author announcing that Harry Potter was a trans-fender female to male. Extremely touchy topic on the social media touch media device.

5. The Sky is Falling. The Fall of the world. The airplanes are virus-bombing the world.

6. At 27 minutes, Helen has Fallen backwards. Like Tim Finnegans ladder fall, Helen has cracked her skull and "died". Note the discoloration around Helen's eyes as she smiles and dies. it was not the virus that killed her, but the Fall on the concrete while doing her book publicity work / job on her smartphone.

7. Jump ahead to Episode Three. At 31 minutes, the hive mind introduces the topic of alcohol "water of life". This is what brings Tim Finnegan back to life. "whiskey is derived from the Irish phrase uisce beatha" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegan%27s_Wake#Summary

&nbsp;

As far as I can tell, one and only one book outside of Carol's own has been named, "Finnegans Wake" in the first three episodes. Anyone caught any others?

&nbsp;

Other observations:

Carol only wants English speakers to meet with at first ..  and she is the only free thinker in the world that has English as a *first language*.  If you study page 3, paragraph 3, word 3 of Finnegans Wake - this is a very significant theme. Tower of Babel, languages:  JoyceGeek, "DON'T PANIC: it's only Finnegans Wake - thunderword #1" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV3vT5nW_I4
