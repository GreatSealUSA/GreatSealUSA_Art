# Helen Academic Wake

At 23 minutes into Episode One of Pluribus, a book publisher and a book author are in a Public House, Helen drops James Joyce's Finnegans Wake on the table at the zero hour, and the Western World / Middle Eastern World ends. The quantum bomb of Finnegans Wake was laid upon the table, and Helen says: if you make one single person* happy happy happy... with your book.

 

Helen then walks outside the bar, looks at social media, falls backwards and cracks her skull like Tim Finnegan.

English First Speakers, English Language, the hive mind of English - is the themes of Finnegans Wake.

.

I don't think Carol is evil, I think Helen spelled it out... that Helen studied Finnegans Wake in graduate school, an academic interpretation of Joyce.

We have the lowest lowest lowest possible interpretation of Quran, Bible, Torah. https://youtu.be/08R1kPdfrHA?t=1914

Specific to Joyce... this guy's videos I have found gets it, he criticizes the academic interpretation of James Joyce very directly.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=squl14tighM

"Misunderstanding of Joyce", "monumental misunderstanding" in that video.
