# Funeral for Humanity *Wake*

Invoking Finnegans Wake in a Public House on the day the world changed, mind blowing day.

Is this a funeral wake for humanity?

Did the RNA virus have a flaw and the hive mind wants to grasp an aspect of humanity, free will, that was not properly captured in the upgrade of Earth?

[I presented the opposite concern, that they NEED to have a funeral ritual](../Observations/COVID-2019_And_Hive_Mind_Day.md)

Is the "anything you want" for the free thinking 12 people, is it "Make a Wish" as they aren't going to live or be downloaded into the Hive Mind afterlife like Helen?

Did the hive mind decide to give them their 12 last suppers?

The TV podium White House - said that they wanted to rescue Carol, were the other free thinkers told this? Maybe she is the only one that they believe can be adapted for into the hive mind, or are they going for all of them?
