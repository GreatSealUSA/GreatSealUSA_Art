"Was our lord of the heights nigh our lady of the valley?
— He was hosting himself up and flosting himself around and ghosting himself to merry her murmur like an andeanupper balkan.     
— Lewd’s carol! Was there rain by any chance, mistandew?     
— Plenty. If you wend farranoch.      
— There fell some fall of littlewinter snow, holy-as-ivory, as well, I gather, jesse?"

"Hwo? Hwy, dairmaidens! Asthoreths, assay! Earthsigh to is heavened.    
Hillsengals, the daughters of the cliffs, responsen. Longsome the samphire coast. From thee to thee, thoo art it thoo, that thouest there. The like the near, the liker nearer. O sosay! A family, a band, a school, a clanagirls. Fiftines andbut fortines by novanas andor vantads by octettes ayand decadendecads by a lunary with last a lone. Whose every has her different from the similies with her site. Sicut campanulae petalliferentes they coroll in caroll round Botany Bay. A dweam of dose innocent dirly dirls.
Keavn! Keavn! And they all setton voicies about singsing music was Keavn! He. Only he. Ittle he. Ah! The whole clangalied. Oh!"

1. Pirate bay
2. Earthsigh, infected Earth
3. Heaven / Eden / Hive Mind heavenly
4. ::: "They coroll in caroll": A portmanteau blending "corolla" (the petals of a flower) with "carol" (a song or dance in a circle). It suggests the girls are like flowers blooming and singing in a ring. :::
5. Pirate bays, southern cross Keppler 22 signal. ::: "Round Botany Bay": Literally refers to the famous Australian bay, but in Joyce's "Dream Language," it also puns on a "bay of botany" (a garden) and the "Botany Bay" area of Trinity College Dublin. :::
6. ::: "A dweam of dose innocent dirly dirls": Written in a mock-childish or lisping tone ("dweam" for dream, "dose" for those). The word "dirly dirls" is a typical Joycean overlap, combining "early," "deary," "dirty," and "girls". It suggests a dreamlike, slightly voyeuristic memory of youth and innocence mixed with a hint of "dirtiness" or earthly reality. :::
