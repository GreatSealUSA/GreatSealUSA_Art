# Words in Finnegans Wake 

## Carol

"Was our lord of the heights nigh our lady of the valley?
— He was hosting himself up and flosting himself around and ghosting himself to merry her murmur like an andeanupper balkan.     
— Lewd’s carol! Was there rain by any chance, mistandew?     
— Plenty. If you wend farranoch.      
— There fell some fall of littlewinter snow, holy-as-ivory, as well, I gather, jesse?"

"Hwo? Hwy, dairmaidens! Asthoreths, assay! Earthsigh to is heavened.

1. Pirate bay
2. Earthsigh, infected Earth
3. Heaven / Eden / Hive Mind heavenly
4. ::: "They coroll in caroll": A portmanteau blending "corolla" (the petals of a flower) with "carol" (a song or dance in a circle). It suggests the girls are like flowers blooming and singing in a ring. :::
5. Pirate bays, southern cross Keppler 22 signal. ::: "Round Botany Bay": Literally refers to the famous Australian bay, but in Joyce's "Dream Language," it also puns on a "bay of botany" (a garden) and the "Botany Bay" area of Trinity College Dublin. :::
6. ::: "A dweam of dose innocent dirly dirls": Written in a mock-childish or lisping tone ("dweam" for dream, "dose" for those). The word "dirly dirls" is a typical Joycean overlap, combining "early," "deary," "dirty," and "girls". It suggests a dreamlike, slightly voyeuristic memory of youth and innocence mixed with a hint of "dirtiness" or earthly reality. :::

"all them fourlegged ems—and why spell dear god with a big thick dhee (why, O why, O why?)—the cut and dry aks and wise form of the semifinal: and, eighteenthly or twentyfourthly, but at least, thank Maurice, lastly when all is zed and done, the penelopean patience of its last paraphe, a colophon of no fewer than seven hundred and thirtytwo strokes tailed by a leaping lasso—who thus at all this marvelling but will press on hotly to see the vaulting feminine libido of those interbranching ogham sex upandinsweeps sternly controlled and easily repersuaded by the uniform matteroffactness of a meandering male fist?"

Was looking for "why" patterns, anything near "why carol". **"wycaro"**. Interesting bits about female sex drive in there.

5. ::: "Doublends Jined" (or "Doublends Jined") is a phrase from James Joyce's notoriously complex final novel, Finnegans Wake, referring to the book itself as a collection of "doubled ends joined" or connected, reflecting its circular, pun-filled, dream-like language and themes of history, family ::: Dublin ends.

Misc ABQ

"A musical group named Finnegans Wake released an album titled 4th, which features a guest musician named Enéas Albuquerque."

"Dedicated members took turns hosting, and we even made occasional trips to Albuquerque, where Elaine had relocated to be with her daughter. By 2008, Elaine’s health was such that she could no longer travel to Santa Fe, so she started her own reading groups in Albuquerque – one for Finnegans Wake, and one for Joyce’s other works. With our de facto leader now bowing out, the Santa Fe group underwent something of a schism – Tamar Stieber wanted to return to the round-robin-read-out-loud approach, and I wanted to slow the pace down even more. We agreed to split, and both reading groups are alive and well to this day." - November 19, 2014 https://joycegeek.com/2014/11/19/16-years-of-joycegroup-geekery/

Albuquerque means "white oak," deriving from the Latin albus (white) and quercus (oak), referring to oak trees common in the Spanish town of Alburquerque, from which the name originates. The New Mexico city was named for the Duke of Alburquerque, but the name evolved from Alburquerque to Albuquerque, with the first "r" dropping over time, and it's nicknamed "The Duke City". 

"in the wood they trembold, humbild, when they heard the stop-; press from domday's erewold. Tiss! Two pretty mistletots ribboned to a tree, up rose liberator”" (Christmas Carol Episode Nine date themes)
