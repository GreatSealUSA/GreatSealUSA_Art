# Helen Fall

Shortly after the mention of Finnegans Wake in the Public House...

Helen falls and cracks hear head. Tim Finnegan.

Maybe if Helen had had some booze like Tim, she would have lived... Carl even proposes that they take a cab home and insists to Helen that she needs a drink. But Hellen declines.

It's also implied Helen did *not* escape the hive mind entrance.

Is Helen still alive, captured?

Genetics skills are part of the story. Can a body be rebuilt and the captured mind download from the hive mind?

## Climbing Tim Ladder to highest Rung of New Media Environment

> My point is your putting a lot of your understanding of the show through the lens of the book when there's nothing concrete to say it has nearly as much to do with the show as you're emphasizing. It's too in your face and on the nose

You are the fandom, social media touch device, Helen is holding. The producers of this show have been wildly famous with other shows and know all about the public.

>  It's too in your face and on the nose

A book publisher and a book author in a Public House are discussing Finnegans Wake book. The book publisher manipulates the public by changing the order of the books at the airport.

After introducing Finnegans Wake at minute 23 of Episode One, and making a statement about *making even one single person happy happy*... the person touching the smartphone (highest rung of media ecology) falls backwards and cracks her head like Tim Finnegan. And on this touch device, the *touchy subject* of gender of the Pirate Lady character being disclosed to the public audience.... highest rung of Tim's ladder in USA society. Trans-gender.

>  It's too in your face and on the nose

Have you ever read Finnegans Wake? it is the least "on the nose" book you will ever read. The *grin* on Helen's face as she dies is "in your face" smile. If you can make even one single person smile....

> there's nothing concrete to say it has nearly as much to do with the show as you're emphasizing

Speaking of concrete, Helen / Tim fall on hard rock and cracked her / his skull. What brings Tim Finnegan back to life? The water of life, booze.

At 31 minutes in Episode Three, the "water of life" is brought up.
