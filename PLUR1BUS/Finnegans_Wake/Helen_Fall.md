# Helen Fall

Shortly after the mention of Finnegans Wake in the Public House...

Helen falls and cracks hear head. Tim Finnegan.

Maybe if Helen had had some booze like Tim, she would have lived... Carl even proposes that they take a cab home and insists to Helen that she needs a drink. But Hellen declines.

It's also implied Helen did *not* escape the hive mind entrance.

Is Helen still alive, captured?

Genetics skills are part of the story. Can a body be rebuilt and the captured mind download from the hive mind?
