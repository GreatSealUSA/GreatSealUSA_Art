# Helen Fall

Shortly after the mention of Finnegans Wake in the Public House...

Helen falls and cracks hear head. Tim Finnegan.

It's also implied Helen did *not* escape the hive mind entrance.

Is Helen still alive, captured?

Genetics skills are part of the story. Can a body be rebuilt and the captured mind download from the hive mind?
