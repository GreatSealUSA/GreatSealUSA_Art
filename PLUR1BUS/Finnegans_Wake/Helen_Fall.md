# Helen Fall

Shortly after the mention of Finnegans Wake in the Public House...

Helen falls and cracks hear head. Tim Finnegan.

Maybe if Helen had had some booze like Tim, she would have lived... Carl even proposes that they take a cab home and insists to Helen that she needs a drink. But Hellen declines.

It's also implied Helen did *not* escape the hive mind entrance.

Is Helen still alive, captured?

Genetics skills are part of the story. Can a body be rebuilt and the captured mind download from the hive mind?

## Climbing Tim Ladder to highest Rung of New Media Environment

> My point is your putting a lot of your understanding of the show through the lens of the book when there's nothing concrete to say it has nearly as much to do with the show as you're emphasizing. It's too in your face and on the nose

You are the fandom, social media touch device, Helen is holding. The producers of this show have been wildly famous with other shows and know all about the public.

>  It's too in your face and on the nose

A book publisher and a book author in a Public House are discussing Finnegans Wake book. The book publisher manipulates the public by changing the order of the books at the airport.

After introducing Finnegans Wake at minute 23 of Episode One, and making a statement about *making even one single person happy happy*... the person touching the smartphone (highest rung of media ecology) falls backwards and cracks her head like Tim Finnegan. And on this touch device, the *touchy subject* of gender of the Pirate Lady character being disclosed to the public audience.... highest rung of Tim's ladder in USA society. Trans-gender.

>  It's too in your face and on the nose

Have you ever read Finnegans Wake? it is the least "on the nose" book you will ever read. The *grin* on Helen's face as she dies is "in your face" smile. If you can make even one single person smile....

> there's nothing concrete to say it has nearly as much to do with the show as you're emphasizing

Speaking of concrete, Helen / Tim fall on hard rock and cracked her / his skull. What brings Tim Finnegan back to life? The water of life, booze.

At 31 minutes in Episode Three, the "water of life" is brought up.

## Fall of the Helen Peacemaker 

In the relationship, Helen is "the calm one" in the marriage. https://youtu.be/hBaiyzj5wdc?t=161 Helen is the P.R. publisher for the couple, she arranges the conversations / dialogs.

# Zero Hour Fall

Fall of free will, free thinking, post-Eden. *Exception... women*. Eve gets blamed for all of Adam's corruption. The new Minute 22 Episode One *Eden takes lesbian Helen* and (along with her) Troubadour year 1210 AMOR protest against backwards-spelled ROMA - the Catholic Church.

* "Zero Hour serves as a metaphor for awakening and awareness, pushing readers to confront societal issues and consider their role in effecting change." https://fiveable.me/key-terms/introduction-contemporary-literature/zero-hour     

Woke, wake, Finnegan's Woke. [*"Zero Hour serves as a metaphor for awakening"...*](https://fiveable.me/key-terms/introduction-contemporary-literature/zero-hour) The same way Helen dies, backwards fall and broken skull. The aftermath of invoking in a Public House the James Joyce book **without taking a drink as Carol requested. No booze, no immunity**. 

* University of Toronto, expert on James Joyce, Marshall McLuhan: "I think you get a certain immunity, just as you get **a certain immunity from booze** by literacy. The literate man can **carry his liquor**, the tribal man cannot. That’s why in the Muslim world or in the native world booze is impossible. It’s the demon rum. However, literacy also makes us very accessible to ideas and propaganda. The literate man is the natural sucker for propaganda. You cannot propagandize a native. You can sell him rum" - September 19, 1977 https://www.organism.earth/library/document/mcluhan-mcmanus  .. ... ... Pirate men and ladies with a bottle of rum dominate the seas between tribes. Seamen and virgin ladies with frozen eggs metaphors abound for the literate ABQ West Gate Vegas metaphors ;)

PUBLIC HOUSE NOTE, DEAR GITHUB CHECKING-OUT PARSERS AND COMPILERS: As always, raw and unedited, needs editing, editing, editing. Like Carol's Bitter Coming out of Closet book, 4.5 years of writing and still needs polish and edit. The Minute 22 scene of Episode One ;)
