"Yes, the name "Kepler," referring to astronomer Johannes Kepler, appears in Finnegans Wake, often linked with mathematics, cosmology, and the "all is number" idea, particularly in discussions of Newton's laws and planetary motion, fitting into Joyce's complex web of scientific, historical, and mythical references. The novel uses puns and multilingual wordplay, so while "Kepler" is present, it's part of the dense linguistic fabric, appearing alongside other scientific figures and concepts. 
Context in the Novel:"

* "Scientific Allusions: The Wake integrates scientific principles, and Kepler's laws of planetary motion (like his third law relating orbital period to distance) are referenced within the text's complex mathematical and cosmic framework."

* "Linguistic Density: Joyce weaves names like Kepler into his portmanteau words and multilingual puns, making direct appearances less straightforward than in conventional texts."

* "Mathematical Structure: Finnegans Wake itself has been shown to possess a fractal, mathematical structure, further connecting it to figures like Kepler."
 
Where to Find It (Example):

You'll find references to Kepler's work within discussions of cosmic cycles, physics, and the "microcosm" of man, often alongside Galileo, Newton, and Tycho Brahe, as seen in analyses like the one on Finwake.com. 

&nbsp;

* "Kepler's Laws: In Chapter 6, Joyce references Kepler's Third Planetary Law (the "harmonic law") through the phrase "cube ratio" ([FW 151](https://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Page_151)). The text juxtaposes mathematical and musical terms to mirror Kepler's Harmonices Mundi, where planetary motions were linked to musical scales."

* "Multilingual Puns: Scholars suggest Joyce may have embedded Kepler's name within various neologisms. For instance, the word "buckler" ([FW 132](https://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Page_132)) has been analyzed as a potential portmanteau involving "buck" and "Kepler," though this remains a subject of literary interpretation."

* "Scientific Context: The novel frequently groups Kepler with other figures of the Scientific Revolution, such as Tycho Brahe, Galileo, and Isaac Newton, often to satirize the shift from mythic to mathematical worldviews."
