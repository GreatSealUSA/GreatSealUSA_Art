"Yes, the name "Kepler," referring to astronomer Johannes Kepler, appears in Finnegans Wake, often linked with mathematics, cosmology, and the "all is number" idea, particularly in discussions of Newton's laws and planetary motion, fitting into Joyce's complex web of scientific, historical, and mythical references. The novel uses puns and multilingual wordplay, so while "Kepler" is present, it's part of the dense linguistic fabric, appearing alongside other scientific figures and concepts. 
Context in the Novel:"

* "Scientific Allusions: The Wake integrates scientific principles, and Kepler's laws of planetary motion (like his third law relating orbital period to distance) are referenced within the text's complex mathematical and cosmic framework."

* "Linguistic Density: Joyce weaves names like Kepler into his portmanteau words and multilingual puns, making direct appearances less straightforward than in conventional texts."

* "Mathematical Structure: Finnegans Wake itself has been shown to possess a fractal, mathematical structure, further connecting it to figures like Kepler."
 
Where to Find It (Example):

You'll find references to Kepler's work within discussions of cosmic cycles, physics, and the "microcosm" of man, often alongside Galileo, Newton, and Tycho Brahe, as seen in analyses like the one on Finwake.com. 

&nbsp;

* "Kepler's Laws: In Chapter 6, Joyce references Kepler's Third Planetary Law (the "harmonic law") through the phrase "cube ratio" ([FW 151](https://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Page_151)). The text juxtaposes mathematical and musical terms to mirror Kepler's Harmonices Mundi, where planetary motions were linked to musical scales."

* "Multilingual Puns: Scholars suggest Joyce may have embedded Kepler's name within various neologisms. For instance, the word "buckler" ([FW 132](https://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Page_132)) has been analyzed as a potential portmanteau involving "buck" and "Kepler," though this remains a subject of literary interpretation."

* "Scientific Context: The novel frequently groups Kepler with other figures of the Scientific Revolution, such as Tycho Brahe, Galileo, and Isaac Newton, often to satirize the shift from mythic to mathematical worldviews."

===========================================

&nbsp;

* "Escape Artist: "buckler; is escapemaster-in-chief from all sorts of houdingplaces" (3.14) links the word to Houdini, suggesting a master of evasion and escape, a key trait of the protagonist HCE." Page 127, an 7-bit ASCII language character seamline ;) https://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Page_127

Escape velocity is a common planetary term, travel concern. Metaphor sauce of Kepler 22B. Escapemaster-in-chief Air Force One references of PLUR1BUS Episode Two escape from Helen's Fall into the We is Us.

&nbsp;

# Latin Ahoy, Pirate Lady

Page 127: "wrote F.E.R.T. on his buckler; is escapemaster-in-chief from all sorts of houdingplaces;"

Pretty damn hard to ignore escape velocity, "buckler" as Kepler, Air Force One POTUS image of Carol standing next to the Seal of the POTUS Eagle.

In Finnegans Wake, "F.E.R.T." is an acronym and pun, likely standing for **"Fulgitudes ejist rowdownan tonuout"** (Latin for "Lightning flashes are downpour thunder")

John One One, Page 3 thunders, abound, Tower of Babel thunders and the authorship of Carol's "Bitter Wake" *work in progress* unpublished / unpolished Minute 22 of Episode One post-doctorate thesis by Helen!

# Deleteriousness

Page 151 of Finnegans Wake    

deleteriousness - this word fits with Vince Gilligan's WGA February 2025 announcement / lecture about sexy bad guys { Walter White, Saul Goodman, Carol's actor in Better Call Saul, Darth Vader } https://deadline.com/2025/02/vince-gilligan-wga-award-speech-1236291243/

* Deleteriousness is the noun form of the adjective "deleterious," meaning the quality of being harmful, damaging, or injurious. It describes something that causes harm, often in a subtle or **unexpected way**, and can refer to physical, **mental, or other types of negative** effects.

&nbsp;

=========================================

&nbsp;

* "Kepler's Third Law: Joyce mentions Kepler's law relating orbital periods (time) and distances in the "Ithaca" episode of Ulysses, using it in a question-and-answer format that contrasts scientific precision with human experience."

* "In essence, Joyce uses Kepler not just as a scientific mention, but as a key to unlock deeper philosophical and structural complexities within his modernist texts."

&nbsp;

Some of us, We is Us, have had to do the hand associations for decades through tools of Marshall McLuhan University of Toronto, Joseph Campbell and his wife Sarah Lawrence College. It's hard to ignore how Google Search + LLM can respond in December 2025 when fed sophisticated keywords as input.

Fiction to fiction, monomyth to monomyth, metaphor to metaphor, system to system:

* "Raised by Wolves: This series prominently features Kepler-22b as the site of a human colony. Some critics analyze its complex, recursive storytelling through the lens of Joycean modernism, particularly its use of "fractal iterative storytelling"."

&nbsp;

Just capturing, I haven't looked into at all

* "The "Page 218" Reference: In one episode, the protagonist Carol (played by Rhea Seehorn) responds to a question about when a character "returns" by whispering "page 218." Fans have identified this as a reference to the page in Finnegans Wake that serves as the transition between Book 1 and Book 2."

* The Midden-Heap Imagery: Viewers have noted that once you "dig in the midden"—a reference to the "midden-heap" in Finnegans Wake—allusions to Joyce appear throughout the show's set design and dialogue."

* "Paralysis and Modernism: Critics have compared the show's world—where a virus makes everyone relentlessly happy—to Joyce's theme of "paralysis" in Dubliners, where characters are trapped by societal or psychological forces they cannot escape."

New World Order of Great Seal, Kepler-22B is a literal interpretation of "New World" ++

&nbsp;

Again, no way have I looked into this:

In the 2025 Apple TV+ series Pluribus, "page 218" is a subtle but significant literary Easter egg referenced in the series premiere, "We Is Us". 

The In-Show Reference: During a scene at a bar, the protagonist Carol Sturka (Rhea Seehorn) is approached by a fan who asks when her character Raban will "return". Carol, a novelist who privately dislikes her own speculative historical romance fiction, whispers "page 218" in response.

The Joycean Connection: Literary fans have identified this as a direct nod to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. In the standard Faber & Faber and Viking Press editions, page 218 marks the exact transition between Book I and Book II.

Narrative Symbolism: In the show, this reference acts as a meta-commentary on the narrative shift. Just as page 218 in Joyce’s work signifies a transition into a more complex, night-themed section of the story, Carol’s reference occurs just as her world transitions from normal life to a surreal, hive-minded dystopia after the "Joining" begins. 

...

A bar? A bookstore?

"The Bar: Later that same night, Carol and her manager/partner Helen (Miriam Shor) go to a local Albuquerque bar to decompress. It is in this bar setting that the "page 218" whisper occurs. After a fan recognizes her and asks for a spoiler about Raban’s return, Carol leans in and whispers "page 218" as a way to get rid of them—a moment fans later linked to the James Joyce transition in Finnegans Wake."

Is this real? I didn't catch this, back to Episode One bar scene. Minute 20 is when the bar scene starts.

Oh, Reddit itself is the "page 218" reference source?  https://old.reddit.com/r/jamesjoyce/comments/1or08bk/anyone_watch_pluribus/

Once you start digging in the midden, the Wake appears everywhere in this show.

For example, when one of Carol’s fans asks when Raban “returns”, she whispers “page 218”. This is the page between Book 1 and Book 2 of the Wake.

There are almost too many things in Book 2 to list but here’s a couple to get you going:

* pub scene

* the character of Taff/Davis Taffler

* the 6th thunder word, associated with Radio, which is the source of the code.

These November 9, 2025 comments are like... a kind like a show insider?

ToDo: minute 32 when Carol goes into the hospital, she the drunk writer (Joyce) says "Wake Up" to an immigrant? doctor. Joyce telling the eastern world to wake up to Western bullshit, 1923 Finn's Hotel of Full Disclosure of London / Washington mutual sleep-walking into massive misinterpretations of Romans 11:32 , ass-backwards "1 John 4:20" and "1 John 3:17" issues, ass-backwards reading of Levant? https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/
