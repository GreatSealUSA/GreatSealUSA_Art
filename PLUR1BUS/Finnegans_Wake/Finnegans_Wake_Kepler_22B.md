"Yes, the name "Kepler," referring to astronomer Johannes Kepler, appears in Finnegans Wake, often linked with mathematics, cosmology, and the "all is number" idea, particularly in discussions of Newton's laws and planetary motion, fitting into Joyce's complex web of scientific, historical, and mythical references. The novel uses puns and multilingual wordplay, so while "Kepler" is present, it's part of the dense linguistic fabric, appearing alongside other scientific figures and concepts. 
Context in the Novel:"

* "Scientific Allusions: The Wake integrates scientific principles, and Kepler's laws of planetary motion (like his third law relating orbital period to distance) are referenced within the text's complex mathematical and cosmic framework."

* "Linguistic Density: Joyce weaves names like Kepler into his portmanteau words and multilingual puns, making direct appearances less straightforward than in conventional texts."

* "Mathematical Structure: Finnegans Wake itself has been shown to possess a fractal, mathematical structure, further connecting it to figures like Kepler."
 
Where to Find It (Example):

You'll find references to Kepler's work within discussions of cosmic cycles, physics, and the "microcosm" of man, often alongside Galileo, Newton, and Tycho Brahe, as seen in analyses like the one on Finwake.com. 

&nbsp;

* "Kepler's Laws: In Chapter 6, Joyce references Kepler's Third Planetary Law (the "harmonic law") through the phrase "cube ratio" ([FW 151](https://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Page_151)). The text juxtaposes mathematical and musical terms to mirror Kepler's Harmonices Mundi, where planetary motions were linked to musical scales."

* "Multilingual Puns: Scholars suggest Joyce may have embedded Kepler's name within various neologisms. For instance, the word "buckler" ([FW 132](https://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Page_132)) has been analyzed as a potential portmanteau involving "buck" and "Kepler," though this remains a subject of literary interpretation."

* "Scientific Context: The novel frequently groups Kepler with other figures of the Scientific Revolution, such as Tycho Brahe, Galileo, and Isaac Newton, often to satirize the shift from mythic to mathematical worldviews."

===========================================

* "Escape Artist: "buckler; is escapemaster-in-chief from all sorts of houdingplaces" (3.14) links the word to Houdini, suggesting a master of evasion and escape, a key trait of the protagonist HCE."

Escape velocity is a common planetary term, travel concern. Metaphor sauce of Kepler 22B. Escapemaster-in-chief Air Force One references of PLUR1BUS Episode Two escape from Helen's Fall into the We is Us.

# Latin Ahoy, Pirate Lady

Page 127: "wrote F.E.R.T. on his buckler; is escapemaster-in-chief from all sorts of houdingplaces;"

Pretty damn hard to ignore escape velocity, "buckler" as Kepler, Air Force One POTUS image of Carol standing next to the Seal of the POTUS Eagle.

In Finnegans Wake, "F.E.R.T." is an acronym and pun, likely standing for **"Fulgitudes ejist rowdownan tonuout"** (Latin for "Lightning flashes are downpour thunder")

John One One, Page 3 thunders, abound, Tower of Babel thunders and the authorship of Carol's "Bitter Wake" *work in progress* unpublished / unpolished Minute 22 of Episode One post-doctorate thesis by Helen!

# Deleteriousness

Page 151 of Finnegans Wake    

deleteriousness - this word fits with Vince Gilligan's WGA February 2025 announcement / lecture about sexy bad guys { Walter White, Saul Goodman, Carol's actor in Better Call Saul, Darth Vader } https://deadline.com/2025/02/vince-gilligan-wga-award-speech-1236291243/

* Deleteriousness is the noun form of the adjective "deleterious," meaning the quality of being harmful, damaging, or injurious. It describes something that causes harm, often in a subtle or **unexpected way**, and can refer to physical, **mental, or other types of negative** effects.

&nbsp;

=========================================

&nbsp;

* "Kepler's Third Law: Joyce mentions Kepler's law relating orbital periods (time) and distances in the "Ithaca" episode of Ulysses, using it in a question-and-answer format that contrasts scientific precision with human experience."

* "In essence, Joyce uses Kepler not just as a scientific mention, but as a key to unlock deeper philosophical and structural complexities within his modernist texts."

Some of us, We is Us, have had to do the hand associations for decades through tools of Marshall McLuhan University of Toronto, Joseph Campbell and his wife Sarah Lawrence College. It's hard to ignore how Google Search + LLM can respond in December 2025 when fed sophisticated keywords as input.
