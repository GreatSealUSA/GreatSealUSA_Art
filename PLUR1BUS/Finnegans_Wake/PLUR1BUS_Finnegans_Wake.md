# PLUR1BUS Finnegans Wake

&nbsp;


The first episode named-dropped James Joyce's Finnegans Wake book right before the mental apocalypse. You can't possibly open a bigger can of worms.

Carol is told she is the only free thinker in the world who speaks English as a *first language*. That has huge meaning in context of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. Rewriting the audience of the English language mind is the very heart and soul of Finnegans Wake.

Finnegans Wake is year 1924 "Woke mind virus" - and it is an overthrow of every hive mind ever known to mankind. Especially the English King and the English language itself!

James Joyce was a heavy drinker, and an Irish pub is the center of the Finnegans Wake story. Booze.

1. Carol has an alcohol detector on the ignition of her car.

2. Carol is at a public house drinking as the globsl apocalypse is unleashed via chemtrails.

3. Carol does not have a mental crash and freeze like other people do when exposed to the virus. However, later that night when she returns to her house: Carol boozes until she goes blackout drunk. She ha a peronsal ritul with whiskey to go into mental reset / blackout state.

4. Carol is a book author with a closely-held manuscript that is unpublished. She is disgusted with the state of commercial book selling and her own state of sleze selling low-importance content. She is afraid her deeper more complex work (like Finnegans Wake) won't sell and have public acceptance. Beinga highly literate preson gives her some special powers with booze / drinking.

* "Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966

* "I think you get a certain immunity, just as you get a certain immunity from booze by literacy. The literate man can carry his liquor, the tribal man cannot. That’s why in the Muslim world or in the native world booze is impossible. It’s the demon rum." - MARSHALL MCLUHAN IN CONVERSATION WITH  MIKE MCMANUS. September 19, 1977
