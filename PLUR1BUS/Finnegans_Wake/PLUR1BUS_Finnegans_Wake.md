# PLUR1BUS Finnegans Wake

&nbsp;


The first episode named-dropped James Joyce's Finnegans Wake book right before the mental apocalypse. You can't possibly open a bigger can of worms.

Carol is told she is the only free thinker in the world who speaks English as a *first language*. That has huge meaning in context of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. Rewriting the audience of the English language mind is the very heart and soul of Finnegans Wake.

Finnegans Wake is year 1924 "Woke mind virus" - and it is an overthrow of every hive mind ever known to mankind. Especially the English King and the English language itself!

James Joyce was a heavy drinker, and an Irish pub is the center of the Finnegans Wake story. Booze.

1. Carol has an alcohol detector on the ignition of her car.

2. Carol is at a public house drinking as the globsl apocalypse is unleashed via chemtrails.

* "I think you get a certain immunity, just as you get a certain immunity from booze by literacy. The literate man can carry his liquor, the tribal man cannot. That’s why in the Muslim world or in the native world booze is impossible. It’s the demon rum." - MARSHALL MCLUHAN IN CONVERSATION WITH  MIKE MCMANUS. September 19, 1977
