* “In fact, a 2015 study by Youyou, Kosinski and Stillwell showed that, using Facebook likes, a computer model reigned supreme in predicting human behaviour. With ten likes, the model predicted a person’s behaviour more accurately than one of their co-workers. With 150 likes, better than a family member. And with 300 likes, the model knew the person better than their own spouse.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf*ck: Inside Cambridge Analytica’s Plot to Break the World. Published year 2019.

In interviews, Vince Gilligan said he knew is core character was a writer, first a man, but he changed the character to a woman.

* "I want to give a picture of Dublin so complete that if the city suddenly disappeared from the earth it could be reconstructed out of my book." - James Joyce (Frank Budgen in conversation with the author, Zürich, 1918; from chapter IV of his 1934 book James Joyce and the Making of "Ulysses")

* “For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal.” ― James Joyce

* ‘The Dublin papers will object to my stories as to a caricature of Dublin life. Do you think there is any truth in this? At times the spirit directing my pen seems to me so plainly mischievous that I am almost prepared to let the Dublin critics have their way. All these these pros and cons I must for the nonce lock up in my bosom. Of course do not think I consider contemporary Irish writing anything but ill-written, morally obtuse, formless caricature.’ - James Joyce, Letter to Stanislaus, 19 July 1905.

* ‘Do you see that man who has just skipped out of the way of the tram? Consider, if he had been run over, how significant every act of his would at once become. I don’t mean for the police inspector. I mean for anybody who knew him. And his thoughts, for anybody that could know them. It is my idea of the significance of trivial things that I want to give the two or three unfortunate wretches who may eventually read me.’  - James Joyce.

REAL WORLD: Why is the device in the limited retail space of an airport in the first place? The wealth of spending on travel. The supply chain. The technology of the machine. What eNeil Postman said in year 1992. The mail-order cheaper price that Helen uses for the gift.
