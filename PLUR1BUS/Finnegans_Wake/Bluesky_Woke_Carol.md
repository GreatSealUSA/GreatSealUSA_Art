Mental #Apocalypse starts when Finnegans Wake is name-dropped in a public house!

Minds freeze and people black out, but Carol does not black out in the public house. Carol waits until her private house with a bottle of whiskey.

# Carol ALP? Great Seal Olive Branch

If Carol is the ALP emphasis on P name sounding like show title...

"Livia is a name of ancient Roman origin from the Latin family name Livius, meaning "blue," "envious," or "to be bluish," but it's also linked to the Hebrew for "lioness" or **"garland," and associated with peace/olive tree**"  

So the Minute 37 Episode Two 4-starts missing of 13 (magic 13 number in Pluribus show) in POTUS Seal, the olive branch is in ALP middle name. Deep symbolism. The show is all about decoding an exotic message from outer space Kepler 22B, so expect some try symbolism like removing 4 stars and having only 9 of the 13 on the POTUS Seal on Air Force One scenes.
