# Mockery Of A Nation: *OutPlurbed*

Out-group anti-Pluribus.   
With out-group logical polarity, attacking the Free Masons symbols of mason / brick-laying Tim Finnegan revival.

1988 Luke SkyWalker Ranch, Gauchos interviews hosted by Lucas:

"or example, the ten commandments say, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then the next chapter says, “Go into Canaan and kill everybody in it.” That is a bounded field. The myths of **participation** and love pertain only to the in-group, and the out-group is **totally** other. This is the sense of the word “gentile” — the person is not of the same order." - [Book Page 22 is indicated on Page 15 in 1995, only 7 years after the first book published.](https://books.google.com/books?id=xZA5DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA15&dq=%22That+is+a+bounded+field.+The+myths+of+participation+and+love+pertain+only+to+the+in-group,+and+the+out-group+is+totally+other.%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

### Dividuum; Apart Man

"the anthropological works of the primitive initiation rites what is done to the young people in some primitive societies in order to test their courage, in order to integrate them in the social group. Now, most societies are extremely dogmatic and fierce in their integration of the individual. The individual is born as a separate entity. He is carved up, so to say, and made to fit into a pattern that the society requires. It doesn't require a total man; it requires *a part man* — not an individual, but a dividuum: someone **who has been divided up and put into a notch**." - Lecture I.1.1 - *The Celebration of Life*.

Orders from on-high, so the story goes.

* "And the society of the Middle Ages was itself a rendition on earth of the imagery of those seven spheres. The entity of the king, and the entity of *the Pope* — these represented agents of the divine powers. And the society was arranged in a hierarchic way, as it were following the order of the angels and the angelic choirs who sang in the heavens. And in this image there was felt to be a perfect accord between the shape and form of the universe, the well-being of the individual, and the order of society, so that by following the laws of the society, and doing as he was told, the individual both was in accord with the order of the universe, and with his own inward order. And then when death came, he passed readily through those spheres again to the heavenly realm."

* "Whereas in our tradition, if anyone says “I am God,” he’s either a maniac, or a great, great saint. And in either case, he will be killed."

* "And it is violent, it’s ugly — there are foul odors and experiences. This is the level of the sadomasochistic attitude. And if the person comes out in this state, the person is in danger of blowing things up, of blowing himself up — he is a dangerous person. The fourth state is that of birth itself. Suddenly light, and suddenly an object: mother — the first divinity, and the only divinity finally, really. I mean this *daddy thing* is a joke... compared with mother."
