# Mockery Of A Nation: *OutPlurbed*

Out-group anti-Pluribus.   
With out-group logical polarity, attacking the Free Masons symbols of mason / brick-laying Tim Finnegan revival.

1988 Luke Skywalker Ranch, Gauchos interviews hosted by Lucas;

"or example, the ten commandments say, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then the next chapter says, “Go into Canaan and kill everybody in it.” That is a bounded field. The myths of participation and love pertain only to the in-group, and the out-group is totally other. This is the sense of the word “gentile”—the person is not of the same order."

And other anti-Pluribus words, anti free masons languages:

1. Gentile (modernized: أمميون / modern Unicode Unity: جنتايل)
2. Infidel / كافر
3. Non-believer
4. OutPlurbed
5. "550" / "neutral"
6. Outcasting, planked-walking dead / casting out the undesired unattractive
