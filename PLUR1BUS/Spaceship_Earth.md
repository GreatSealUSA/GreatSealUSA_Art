# Spaceship Earth

Finnegans Wake, Marshall McLuhan media ecology.

Media theorist Marshall McLuhan, who famously stated, "There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew". This quote, often associated with R. Buckminster Fuller who popularized the "Spaceship Earth" concept, suggests that all humans are interdependent and share responsibility for the planet's well-being, with no one being a passive observer.

The year 1940 film with Charlie Chaplin, The Great Dictator. It comes to mind in better-written words than my own: "I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness."
