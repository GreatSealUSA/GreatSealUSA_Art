# Worldwide? It's A Few

22 minutes into second episode.

The hive mind lies to Carol. Deception.

The English word "few" has a rather precise meaning in USA in my experience.  the word "few" indicates an indefinitely small quantity.

Unless the context is established, like discussing a house being worht millions of dollars and someone saying "a few"...

When Carol asks how many died, the initial answer of "a few" is deceptive.
