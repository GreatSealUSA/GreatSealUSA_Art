Cultural osmosis self-awareness. Second hand smoke (second hand memes, second hand clips, second hand memorized lines). Betty White as cultural hero in USA.

USA shows that many other culturers would traditionally not relate to. Grandparents who do not live with other family members, don't play a daily role in grandchildren lives. The USA lifestyle of segregating elderly from newborns indaily living and new married couples who send children away to daycare or hired help / nanny (paid strangers). Latchkey kids of the 1980's USA.

Television as "friends" for a middle class married couple (Carol and Helen). From one of the most successful television show creators in the world (Breaking Bad, Saul)... who depicts "White" family values and vehavior of suburban indeepndent houses.
