### Television / Golden Girls

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvf3t_FXbW8

Cultural osmosis self-awareness. Second hand smoke (second hand memes, second hand clips, second hand memorized lines). Betty White as cultural hero in USA.

USA shows that many other culturers would traditionally not relate to. Grandparents who do not live with other family members, don't play a daily role in grandchildren lives. The USA lifestyle of segregating elderly from newborns indaily living and new married couples who send children away to daycare or hired help / nanny (paid strangers). Latchkey kids of the 1980's USA.

Television as "friends" for a middle class married couple (Carol and Helen). From one of the most successful television show creators in the world (Breaking Bad, Saul)... who depicts "White" family values and vehavior of suburban indeepndent houses.

### Writer Director changes between episodes

How many people who watch shows are self-aware that episodes can have entirely different directors and writers.

### Novel series 7 years

Like having an entire TV series, like Breaking Bad is a book publish

### "We'll put things right"

Researching a show, taglines and other media that is outside the show content / dialog. What is used to set audience expectations.

The show writers are telling us what "fixing the world" or "fixing Carol" (or her marriage) is the arc of the story.

### Long Distance RunAround

https://youtu.be/dvf3t_FXbW8?t=292

Yes song. Long Distance RunAround 

Carol seating. Wishing to share public with witnesses. Pirate radio / media piracy / Pirate Lady / Eye in the Sky reading your mind (Great Seal Eye, Alan Parsons song).

#### "The Adults In The Room"

Carol and Helen. The book writers, the book publishers. 

This nonfiction book was published two months before COVID-19 was discovered in Wuhan, China in year 2019. “**We are socialized to place trust in our institutions — our government**, our police, our schools, our regulators. It’s as if we assume there’s some guy with a secret team of experts sitting in an office with a plan, and if that plan doesn’t work, don’t worry, he’s got a plan B and a plan C—someone in charge will take care of it. But in truth, that guy doesn’t exist. If we choose to wait, nobody will come.”
― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America. Published October 8, 2019. Page 19.

### Hate language Tower of Babel

https://youtu.be/dvf3t_FXbW8?t=468

Reprsentative of humanity.

### Global hivemind context, mass man context

https://youtu.be/dvf3t_FXbW8?t=530

### Binge food / Binge TV

Comfrot media.

https://youtu.be/dvf3t_FXbW8?t=562

### Closh reflection

https://youtu.be/dvf3t_FXbW8?t=575

### Prayers to God above

Prayers to clouds / man yells at cloud hive mind / cloud computing. Karen complains to manager.

https://youtu.be/dvf3t_FXbW8?t=680

### Sarcastic known

Alas, if you stalk a REAL TV star like real actresses experience. If you schoot up a real school because of media messages. If you clash with REAL racial issues, real langauge issues to other people in the world....

https://youtu.be/dvf3t_FXbW8?t=738

Detached from religion ideals, mass man self awareness as a book author / book publisher.

### Drowning Carol

https://youtu.be/dvf3t_FXbW8?t=813

Rescuing Carol from a broken society / Campbell's Wasteland.  Society and Carol both have issues.

Rick Steve's travel writer for USA society to know the world for cheap / not rich people's travel.

### Carol can not "read the room"

https://youtu.be/dvf3t_FXbW8?t=909

Carol can not do what autistic medical community calls "mind blindness", "theory of mind" of other people. Empathy mind-reading. She can not tell REALITY. As a fiction book author, Carol only thinks of fiction, not to confirm the reality of the explosives. She lives in a filter-bubble / egoism of her own authoring / dictatorship to nature. She does not have a scientific attitude that illusions cover up reality. Neil Postman's media ecology book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" with television shows and comfot food and booze and pills... and she lets a *stranger* into her hosue with detachment of mail-order drugs and mail-order supply chain. Has she never read of the Trojan Horse, a mail-order gift delivery that is an explosive? Yet she is the onec calling to science arms about defending against the *hostile* alien invasion?

Carol can not read REALITY of the REAL ROOM. The elctric grid, the hand grenade. She even says on the ice room, that the northern lights look like a *computer screen saver* of Windows (trademark). That was 7 years earlier, and here it is STILL stuck in a detached from reality inner fiction author world.

This is heard-core Joyce Finnegans Wake... Waking the Finnegans to real reality, not what they have been told by The Church and Clergy.

### My Wife Helen

https://youtu.be/dvf3t_FXbW8?t=979

My Wife... "Gonna buy a tank and an airplane. When she catches up with me won't be no time to explain.
She thinks I've been with another woman and that's enough to send her half-insane! Gonna buy a fast car, put on my lead boots, and take a long, long drive. I may end up spendin' all my money But I'll still be alive!" 

1. Some tellings of Finnegans Wake have the wife guitar smashes Tim Finnegan over the head at the end. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdizZtOddC8

3. 1971 The Who - guitar smashers -  (female cover) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYXQ9VOKPO8

### Vegas in the context

Last episode ended with Air Force One going to Vegas, but Carol in this episode is not on Air Force One. Yet, her compansion / chaperone is back. And public show previews have depicted Carol driving up to a hotel in Vegas.

In Stephen King's "The Stand" science fiction / mythology story, a virus outbreak on a military base of USA government escapes - like the rat bite.. through breach of the protective lab gear. And a man free will *does ask for a nuclear bomb* weapon.... setting: Vegas. Also in greater context, Fallout TV show season 2 is going to Vegas (and has Elvis references, and Air Force One choose Vegas hotel as a destination for Elvis fame). Mass man / hive mind / media ecology mindsets.


### My big picture

Episode 3 and the handing of weapons and power to Carol.  It is a metaphor for wealthy families giving their less-experienced less-understanding children what they ask for. Coaching the children not to use sacasm / satire / cleverness to ask for bad things. Like Walter White developing is high-purity meath consistently cheap and fast. Just because you can go to science school and be a chemist and learn to do what Walter White does, a powerful parent encourages the children not to choose such paths.

Carol can get a hand grenade and blow up her house. The hive mind is telling carol tobe careful. Like a wealthy parent who can afford to replace the wrecked car of a 15 year old child who doesn'treally understand the power they have. 

The comprehension / knolwedge / experience of the hive mind sees the risk in satire and joking and mocking serious matters like playing with handguns as entertainment, "weapons are cool", "fireworks are cool", "celebratory gunfire" that real adults do in the world. Drag racing cars for entertainment and sport.
