there's no simple answer for how *we* might change that. Though, if there were, I bet it would have something to do with climbing up out of the cesspool that is social media and actually listening to each other

But I don't know how to make that happen. So, I'll stick to my wheelhouse as
a writer speaking to a room full of
writers. I have a proposal.

"So what I suddenly realized when I recognized that in the Great Seal of the United States there were two of these symbolic triangles interlocked was that we now had thirteen points, for our thirteen original states, and that there were now, furthermore, no less than six apexes, one above, one below, and four (so to say) to the four quarters. The sense of this, it seemed to me, might be that from above or below, or from any point of the compass, the creative Word might be heard, which is the great thesis of democracy. Democracy assumes that anybody from any quarter can speak, and speak truth, because his mind is not cut off from the truth. All he has to do is clear out his passions and then speak." - Skywalker Ranch California lessons for Skywalkers. Published 1988.

# The Fall of *Social* Mankind, Unicode Babel

"with climbing up out of the cesspool **that is social media** and actually listening to each other" - Screenplay Writer Vince Gilligan. Writers Guild of America. February 15, 2025.

* "Eternal September or the September that never ended was a **cultural phenomenon during a period beginning around late 1993** and early 1994, when Internet service providers began offering Usenet access to many new users" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September

* Also 1993: "In the world of Baudrillard **social relations have disappeared between humans**, because humans have begun to disappear. In fact Baudrillard thinks that reality itself is in the process of disappearing." - Texan Rick Roderick, Duke University https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

# HCE Everybody Poops  

Here Comes Everybody     
Book: Everybody Poops (みんなうんち)   
Cesspool recirculations 

Languages John 1:1 abound: みんなうんち https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyone_Poops

James Joyce

1. "cesspool cleaners at the back gaze" appears in the II.3 manuscript draft 6B.1 lexicon text

2. In *Ulysses*, Leopold Bloom is threatened with being "suffocated in the one cesspool"

3.  falling into a cesspool is also a direct callback to Stephen Dedalus's childhood trauma in *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, where a classmate pushes him into a toilet's cesspool

4. Finnegans Wake page opening. "commodius vicus of recirculation" for a toilet, serves to bring together the Adam and Eve (Apple plucking) profound and the everyday, the sublime and the dirty

5. "Stephen's fall at age 6 probably refers to his being pushed into the cesspool at Clongowes Wood College (Portrait). Bloom's fall at age 16 probably refers to a time when, in his father's words, he gets "drunk as dog" with some "running chaps" (Bloom says they are called "Harriers, father")," https://www.joyceproject.com/info/mE-kJZUBeQi-aLQfQLNv

6. https://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Page_338 Page 338 Carol the "Citizen soldiers" (13). "TAFF (porumptly helping himself out by the cesspull with a yellup yurrup, puts up his furry furzed hare). Butly bitly! Humme to our mounthings."
