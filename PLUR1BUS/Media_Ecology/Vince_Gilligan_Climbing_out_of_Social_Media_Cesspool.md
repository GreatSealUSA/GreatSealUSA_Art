there's no simple answer for how *we* might change that. Though, if there were, I [bet](https://youtu.be/Ne2vIoVc7mo?t=55) it would have *something to do with [climbing](https://youtu.be/J4_wXPZ1Bnk?t=102) up out of* the cesspool that is social media and [actually listening](https://youtu.be/QkF3oxziUI4?t=427) to each *other*.

But I don't know how to make that happen. So, I'll stick to my wheelhouse. As
a writer speaking to a room full of writers, I have a proposal...

cool. When that happens fictional bad guys stop being the cautionary tales that they were intended to to be. **God help us**, they become *aspirational*! So [maybe](https://youtu.be/e7olfvXs2R4?t=140) what the [world needs *now*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfHAs9cdTqg) are some good old fashion

"So what I suddenly realized when I recognized that in the Great Seal of the United States there were two of these symbolic triangles interlocked was that we now had thirteen points, for our thirteen original states, and that there were now, furthermore, no less than six apexes, one above, one below, and four (so to say) to the four quarters. The sense of this, it seemed to me, might be that from above or below, or from any point of the compass, the creative Word might be heard, which is the great thesis of democracy. Democracy assumes that anybody from any quarter can speak, and speak truth, because his mind is not cut off from the truth. All he has to do is clear out his passions and then speak." - Skywalker Ranch California lessons for Skywalkers. Published 1988.

* "Eternal September or the September that never ended was a **cultural phenomenon during a period beginning around late 1993** and early 1994, when Internet service providers began offering Usenet access to many new users" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September

* Also 1993: "In the world of Baudrillard **social relations have disappeared between humans**, because humans have begun to disappear. In fact Baudrillard thinks that reality itself is in the process of disappearing." - Texan Rick Roderick, Duke University https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

Cesspool recirculations 

Languages John 1:1 abound: みんなうんち https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyone_Poops

&nbsp;

James Joyce

1. "cesspool cleaners at the back gaze" appears in the II.3 manuscript draft 6B.1 lexicon text

2. In *Ulysses*, Leopold Bloom is threatened with being "suffocated in the one cesspool"

3.  falling into a cesspool is also a direct callback to Stephen Dedalus's childhood trauma in *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, where a classmate pushes him into a toilet's cesspool

4. Finnegans Wake page opening. "commodius vicus of recirculation" for a toilet, serves to bring together the Adam and Eve (Apple plucking) profound and the everyday, the sublime and the dirty

5. "Stephen's fall at age 6 probably refers to his being pushed into the cesspool at Clongowes Wood College (Portrait). Bloom's fall at age 16 probably refers to a time when, in his father's words, he gets "drunk as dog" with some "running chaps" (Bloom says they are called "Harriers, father")," https://www.joyceproject.com/info/mE-kJZUBeQi-aLQfQLNv

6. https://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Page_338 Page 338 Carol the "Citizen soldiers" (13). "TAFF (porumptly helping himself out by the cesspull with a yellup yurrup, puts up his furry furzed hare). Butly bitly! Humme to our mounthings."

* November 10... "Vince Gilligan's new series *Pluribus* first aired on Friday, November 7, 2025, releasing its first two episodes ("We Is Us" & "Pirate Lady") on Apple TV"

We haven't had that listening spirit here since 1969...

* "I bet it would have something to do with climbing up out of the cesspool that is social media and actually listening to each other" - Vince Gilligan. February 15, 2025. Writing television. Student of New York University. World famous NYU for media studies of Neil Postman.

why I love doing these breakdowns and
diving in and like **truly listening to
something actively** and listening to the
lyrics because I never realized you had
such dark, twisted, interpretive
storytelling. 

Hotel California can be a
sanctuary for some. It can be a prison
for others. It can allude to fame. Can
allude to hedonism. Can allude to
society as a whole. It can allude to our
own minds being prisoners of our own
past, our own ghosts within our own
heads and just wanting to forget can be
that escapism. And for me, that ultimate
escapism is what happens here with the
music, right? We stop with the lyricism
now. And like we've we've said enough
about never leaving. And then you just
give into the night and you give into
the sounds and you give into the music.
And instead of overthinking this with
logic, you just close your eyes and you
give into the emotions and just forget.

And wow, I I'm I'm so impressed with
with the lyricism of that. I'm I'm I'm
like stuttering here because I something
**I've never ever realized** or appreciated.
I've really enjoyed that.
