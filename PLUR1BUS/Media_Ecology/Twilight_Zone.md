Peaceful Valley, **New Mexico**  

"whether he knows it or not his friend's shortcut has led him right into the capital of the Twilight Zone."

January 17, 1963    

"The girl uses a strange device to make the dog disappear."    
Social media devices, ICE deportation devices.    

"the town's hotel. Ellen, the proprietor, is as curt as the gas station attendant and insists they have no rooms available even though the keys to all the rooms are still on display at the check-in desk."     
December 24 / December 25 season ending abounds. Luke 2:7 *science fiction* storytelling traditions.   

"He drives out of town only to run into an invisible wall which totals his car and kills Rollie. A band of Peaceful Valley residents are waiting at the scene and take him to the town elders while another resident *brings Rollie back to life**."      
Is Pirate Lady alive, is Helen dead? Did Carol's companion, Helen, *fall* and crash on the [concrete](https://youtu.be/k0BWlvnBmIE?t=57) at the Zero Hour of a Public House, [like Tim Finnegan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus)?     

"The elders refuse to share this technology, given to the town 104 years earlier by a scientist from an unknown planet, until "men learn the ways of peace." Philip rebukes them for decreeing themselves the sole people capable of using these extraterrestrial gifts responsibly, and for squandering technology that could be used to cure all illness and end hunger."       
Sounds pretty *judgmental* of Philip against the town in New Mexico. The science fiction story Bible verse "1 John 3:17" comes to mind. What valley is in? Psalm 23:4 ?
