Helen and Carol were decompression after arriving at ABQ airport in Episode One.

But a signal from outer space that has been compression technology advancement of another world and delivery was a form of heavy weighted experience.

This was a military world war, biological world war, that took only a few days to clean up the aftermath! The wipe-out was extreme. The time-band narrow. Compression of all world ecents.

All languages have now been marked, all knowledge merged, in an extremely short time period. Massive compression in terms of all children education bypassed!

An event where every child now is peering with adults. No need to learn clunky and slow verbal and writing, it's all just instantly there. The compression of age growth. Whiplash of change!

Suddenly so many mysteries of past life are resolved. Cheating spouses, sabotage, killers, rapists, cheaters, thefts, who caused accidents and why. All suddenly uncompressed into realized information.
