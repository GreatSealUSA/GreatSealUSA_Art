# Episode One: Four Months

The White House podium guy (Davis Taffler) on TV tells Carol that the hive mind estimates it will take 4 months to address why the virus did not work on Carol.

He also estimates to Carol that it will take 3 days, "the next few days", for the cleanup effort after the world distribution of the virus.

He says "fix it" like it was a technical problem, that the virus did not work on Carol.
