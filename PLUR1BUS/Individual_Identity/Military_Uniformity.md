# Military Uniformity

It's concerning after 4 epiosdes how few peoplein the audience do not recognize that humanity has a long traiditon of giving up individual free will ... military.

> Would we give up ourselves to stop suffering, or will we cling to our pain and individuality?

I think military people do give up their individuality and free choice, for the purpose of *causing suffering* of out-groups. Parents send their 18 year old children that haven't experienced free adulthood, off to die. Again and again in all geographic parts of the world, this is the pattern.  Look at 1942 Japan and 1942 Germany both, two entirely different religion systems, two entirely different lifestyles / languages / societies. Yet, parents and leaders in both places abandoned individual identity to all dress in uniform clothing and eat uniform food and follow impersonal leaders. For the sake of killing.

REF: "Japan 1944: The conscription age was lowered to include men as young as 15 due to a severe manpower shortage."
