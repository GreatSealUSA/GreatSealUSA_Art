Skywalker Ranch, "The Power of Myth", published year 1988:

BILL MOYERS: How does one have a profound experience?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: By having a profound sense of the mystery.

MOYERS: But if God is the **god we have only imagined, how can we stand in awe of our own creation**?

CAMPBELL: How can we be terrified by a dream? You have to break past your image of God to get through to the connoted illumination. The psychologist Jung has a relevant saying: “Religion is a **defense against the experience of God**.”

The mystery has been reduced to a set of concepts and ideas, and emphasizing these concepts and ideas can **short-circuit the transcendent, connoted experience**. An intense experience of mystery is what one has to regard as the ultimate religious experience.

MOYERS: There are many Christians who believe that; to find out who Jesus is, you have to go past the Christian faith, past the Christian doctrine, past the Christian Church —

CAMPBELL: You have to go past the imagined image of Jesus. Such an image of one’s god becomes a **final obstruction, one’s ultimate barrier. You hold on to your own ideology, your own little manner of thinking**, and when a larger experience of God approaches, an experience **greater than you are prepared to receive**, you take flight from it by clinging to the image in your mind. This is known as preserving your faith.
