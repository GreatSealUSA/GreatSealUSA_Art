# Interesting Interview

Series co-creator Peter Gould caught up with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the midseason premiere — written by Gordon Smith and directed by Vince Gilligan — and the surprising pace that emerges from not saving your biggest character deaths for the very end. He also talks about giving Lalo the right send-off, the mind games at the beginning of the episode and what the last scene means for a certain notorious insect from Breaking Bad.

Question:     
In my mind, there were whole days in the writers room where you went over that first Saul introduction on Breaking Bad over and over and over again like the Zapruder film or like you’re **grad students studying James Joyce**. How accurate is that hypothetical?

Answer:     
Saul Goodman’s introduction to our world was my third produced episode of television. I’d done long-form before that, and that was only the second time I was actually on set as a writer. So I think every moment of that shoot is burned into my memory. Everything subsequent is a little bit of a blur, but that’s burned into my memory, the joy of seeing Bob play this role for the first time. I had no idea that I was going to be watching him play the role for 12 more years. It just seems too good to be true.

So this comment is indicating that Peter was there for the first episode. The question about graduate students and Joyce fits **Minute 22 of Episode One** statement from Helen at the Zero Hour countdown "00:00:00:00".

"After Better Call Saul ended in August 2022, he pitched a new series that he would develop with Sony Pictures Television. A bidding took place, and Apple TV won the rights to the show in September 2022"    
July 11, 2022 interview fits the timing!
