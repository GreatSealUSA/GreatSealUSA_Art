The next generation Copy Past

George Lucas tried to save the world.

After the massive success of A New Hope, Star Wars 1977, George Lucas did something nobody could imagine.

Lucas gave up directing, hired his university teacher (USC mentor Irvin Kershner, U.S.C. as in *University*). He went back to school after making the best received California independent film in human history, "A New Hope". Instead of egoism, he promoted university think-tank ideals!

Then Lucas did something else. He dug a book author out of the gravve at age 81, showed / screned his film and begged hi to help educate the next directors

He has 3 prequels to make and he wanted the university pipeline to know an educated audience

Instead, murder-mocking Red Letter Media... Milwaukee Laverne and Shirley, Plinket and a hooker, Half in the bag beer consumers of Leverne and Shirly TV... came out.

Plinket constantly played up elderly issues, brain pills. Mocking 83 year old Joseph Campbell.

Star Trek eclipsed Star Wars 1988 book.

People gave Campbell Credit for the "Monomyth" and "Heroe's Journey" and not the 1988 Lucas and bill Moyes book

Bill Moyers was a fucking White House USA Government nerd!

Lucas wanted Finnegans Wake, Jean Erdman educated directors. David Lynch more like James Joyce.

But nobody wanted to read the Bill Moyers interview.

Star Wars Fans on Reddit don't quote it, that's for sure!
