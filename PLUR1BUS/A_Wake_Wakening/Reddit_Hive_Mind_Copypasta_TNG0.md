The next generation Copy Past

George Lucas tried to save the world.

After the massive success of A New Hope, Star Wars 1977, George Lucas did something nobody could imagine.

Lucas gave up directing, hired his university teacher (USC mentor Irvin Kershner, U.S.C. as in *University*... School of Cinematic Arts). He went back to school after making the best received California independent film in human history, "A New Hope". Instead of egoism, he promoted university think-tank ideals!

* The fandom consistently rates the 2nd film the ultimate one in the series. To make a second film by giving up directing... was an executive decision egomaniacs could not make, but Lucas made the fandom legend of Empire Strikes Back by cultivating teachers as role models. Like 1985 Campbell to come.

   * "Your statement captures the essence of George Lucas's strategic shift post-original Star Wars: he stepped back from directing, enlisted his mentor Irvin Kershner (USC alum/prof) for Empire Strikes Back, and focused on innovation and creative control, essentially building a film think-tank with ILM & Skywalker Sound, rather than ego-driven directing for sequels, even selling it all to Disney later to fund his vision." (response to previous paragraph by Google Search)

Then Lucas did something else. He dug a book author out of the gravve at age 81, showed / screned his film and begged hi to help educate the next directors

He has 3 prequels to make and he wanted the university pipeline to know an educated audience

Instead, murder-mocking Red Letter Media... Milwaukee Laverne and Shirley, Plinket and a hooker, Half in the bag beer consumers of Leverne and Shirly TV... came out.

Plinket constantly played up elderly issues, brain pills. Mocking 83 year old Joseph Campbell.

Star Trek eclipsed Star Wars 1988 book.

People gave Campbell Credit for the "Monomyth" and "Heroe's Journey" and not the 1988 Lucas and bill Moyes book

Bill Moyers was a fucking White House USA Government nerd!

Lucas wanted Finnegans Wake, Jean Erdman educated directors. David Lynch more like James Joyce.

But nobody wanted to read the Bill Moyers interview.

Star Wars Fans on Reddit don't quote it, that's for sure!

TODO: I speed wrote this, lots of rework, I may not finish it ever

ToDo: Moyers came back after Campbell's death to re-assert the need for people to cite / focus on the 1988 Power of Myth book, but still ignored by directors and fandom in favor of crediting "Monomyth" to Campbell and not Joyce. Joyce Star Wars Day 1939 too much to stomach as inception for directors and fandom both!

TODO: LOTS OF REWRITE. I'm tossing in big ideas without the digestion of hours it needs.
