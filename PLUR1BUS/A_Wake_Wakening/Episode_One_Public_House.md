# A *Wake* Wakening

> We are watching Bitter Chrysalis?

In a Public House setting...

A *married* book publisher and a book author [can't stand the *reading public*](../Joyce/Reading_Public_Joyce.md) on the final book tour of all time. "Work In Progress" was the original name of Finnegans Wake in year 1924. Bitter Chrysalis still needs polish and editing, maybe some gender swaps ;)

Carol is a boozer on the 12 step program (step 13 remains, 13 free thnkers), Tim Finnegan drunkard, and Helen does the ladder fall onto her back and cracks her head... but is Helen *really* gone?

The draft of the unfinished Bitter book was published to the world wide web / hive mind by Helen upon her death, uploaded into the cloud. But Carol is still the author, Carol has to polish and edit.

## You Lucky One

Carol got her fiction creation, the Pirate Lady, come to life in title of episode 2. A very dramatic point is made of the thought invovled, *out of Africa* special delivery. The hive mind has power and resources.  🎵 "I could rip you to shreds, but I'm much too nice" 🎵

Lyrics:    
🎵 "Take me back to the start, were you always aware?", "Am I getting the gist, am I getting warm?"  🎵

...

🎵 You've been off the grid, cutting your teeth... supposedly composing your masterpiece. If you give good copy then I'll cut you some slack... But you better remember when it all comes back! And you're lying on the corner of Merchant's Quay, telling the world how it's meant to be? 🎵

[" riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend    
of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to     
Howth Castle and Environs."](https://www.finwake.com/ch01/ch01.htm)

# High Mind / Hive Mind

Is Joyce making a point (among many other points) that booze is kind of self-administered temporary virus? The inhibition people can sometimes have when high / drunk? Like Carol, Joyce was a heavy boozer, and drinking is part of the story of Waking / Woke. How meth changes minds, how money changes minds, how fiction books change minds..
