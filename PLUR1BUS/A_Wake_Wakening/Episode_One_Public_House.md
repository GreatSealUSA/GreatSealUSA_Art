# A *Wake* Wakening

> We are watching Bitter Chrysalis?

In a Public House setting...

A book publisher and a book author [can't stand the *reading public*](../Joyce/Reading_Public_Joyce.md) on the final book tour of all time. "Work In Progress" was the original name of Finnegans Wake in year 1924. Bitter Chrysalis still needs polish and editing, maybe some gender swaps ;)

Carol is a boozer on the 12 step program (step 13 remains, 13 free thnkers), Tim Finnegan drunkard, and Helen does the ladder fall onto her back and cracks her head... but is Helen *really* gone?

The draft of the unfinished Bitter book was published to the world wide web / hive mind by Helen upon her death, uploaded into the cloud. But Carol is still the author, Carol has to polish and edit.

Carol got her fiction creation, the Pirate Lady, come to life in title of episode 2.
