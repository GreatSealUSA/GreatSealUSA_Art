# A *Wake* Wakening

> We are watching Bitter Chrysalis?

In a Public House setting...

A *married* book publisher and a book author [can't stand the *reading public*](../Joyce/Reading_Public_Joyce.md) on the final book tour of all time. "Work In Progress" was the original name of Finnegans Wake in year 1924. Bitter Chrysalis still needs polish and editing, maybe some gender swaps ;)

Carol is a boozer on the 12 step program (step 13 remains, 13 free thnkers), Tim Finnegan drunkard, and Helen does the ladder fall onto her back and cracks her head... but is Helen *really* gone?

The draft of the unfinished Bitter book was published to the world wide web / hive mind by Helen upon her death, uploaded into the cloud. But Carol is still the author, Carol has to polish and edit.

## You Lucky One

Carol got her fiction creation, the Pirate Lady, come to life in title of episode 2. A very dramatic point is made of the thought invovled, *out of Africa* special delivery. The hive mind has power and resources.  🎵 "I could rip you to shreds, but I'm much too nice" 🎵

Lyrics:    
🎵 "Take me back to the start, were you always aware?", "Am I getting the gist, am I getting warm?"  🎵

...

🎵 You've been off the grid, cutting your teeth... supposedly composing your masterpiece. If you give good copy then I'll cut you some slack... But you better remember when it all comes back! And you're lying on the corner of Merchant's Quay, telling the world how it's meant to be? 🎵

# High Mind / Hive Mind

Is Joyce making a point (among many other points) that booze is kind of self-administered temporary virus? The inhibition people can sometimes have when high / drunk? Like Carol, Joyce was a heavy boozer, and drinking is part of the story of Waking / Woke. How meth changes minds, how money changes minds, how fiction books change minds..

# Carol's Adult Cigarette 

Helen's feedback to Carol that sign is on the wall that her book tour is finished and now the publication of her Bitter Pupa book should be next. And Finnegans Wake is dropped on the table, exploding the universe at a quantum bomb level. https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/concern/theses/dj52w5145 "James Joyce Incorporates the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Theory to Consolidate Opposites in Finnegans Wake" Masters Thesis. 

Helen handed Carol the Atom Bomb of human mindsets / clergy hive mind in a Public House, the setting of Finnegans Wake. Like Episode 3, Carol does not immediately intellectually understand what Helen just said. And Helen's equation about art and *making even one single person happy happy*. But that's Episode 3, and we are in episode one. But Carol *does know* that what Helen said was a Big Fucking Deal.

So the Cigarette. Helen just mind-fucked Carol in a consentual way in the Public House. They have finally consented their second stage of marriage. ("It’s not simply one’s own thing, you see. It is, in a sense, doing one’s own thing, but the one isn’t just you, it’s the two together as one. And that’s a **purely mythological image signifying the sacrifice of the visible entity for a transcendent good**. This is something that becomes beautifully realized in the **second stage of marriage, what I call the alchemical stage, of the two experiencing that they are one**. If they are still living as they were in the primary stage of marriage, they will go apart when their children leave. Daddy will fall in love with some little nubile girl and run off, and Mother will be left with an empty house and heart, and will have to work it out on her own, in her own way.")

So, to recap what I am saying: Carol didn't understand fully what Helen just said about her graduate school study of Finengans Wake, Carol has likely never touched by Finnegans Wake. But the *weight* of the Wake, the density of Plutonium creation in a breeder reactor *was felt in the heart to heart talk of spouses*. It was felt *so deeply* by Carol, that she felt they had just consuated the marriage. They just passed second stage threshold. And Carol wanted a cigarette after being heart-fucked / mid-fucked by Helen into unity marriage. They had just created the ultimate human hivemind of Troubadour year 1210 choice marriage. It had flowered out of their partnership. They walk outside to do the smoke ritual celebration (after dialog spiritual intercourse / sexual intercourse consumation).

Maybe it was at that point, in her mind, the egg timer of the frozen eggs was going to ring for Carol? Don't know... but looking at future episodes for discussion of age and menopause and more than just polish / edit / publish of Carol's deeper Bitter Pupa book. (Pupa being a stage of development, Campell's stage of marriages, society Finnegans Wake 4 stage cycles, etc, etc).
