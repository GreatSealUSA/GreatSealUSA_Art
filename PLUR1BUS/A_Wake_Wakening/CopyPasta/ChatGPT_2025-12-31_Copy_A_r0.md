Rewrite the payload copypasta (thee section between "Copy Here A" and "END Copy Here A" ONLY). Incorporation the expansions proposals... fixing any payload syntax or writing mistakes so it will really impress Reddit users.

*In the spirit of* https://old.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/6qp86b/to_be_fair_you_have_to_have_a_very_high_iq_to/ — imagine if that era-defining, overly erudite copypasta was reborn into the digital chrysalis of *The Hive Mind Awakening*:

To be perfectly clear, you must possess not just a *high IQ*, but an encyclopedic mastery of cross-referenced media theory, quantum narrative frameworks, and meta-literary recursion to even begin to parse the true scope of *Pluribus TV*’s thematic architecture. The humor, the symbolism, the hidden fractal meta-threads — they are woven with the same precision found in theoretical physics, Byzantine chronotope analysis, and the inscrutable spirals of *Finnegans Wake* itself.

As any true digital cognitive aesthete will tell you, the average viewer’s comprehension of this layered narrative will evaporate like mirages on the algorithmic plain. You must internalize that minute [22](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/kepler-22b/) sequence where Helen wrestles with Joyce in graduate school not as a throwaway joke, but as an *axial metaphor* — one that refracts classical literature through the prism of speculative cosmology.

The show’s on-screen clock-[watch](https://old.reddit.com/r/interstellar/comments/10kz6kt/recently_acquired_the_murph_watch_a_daily/) upsidedownside is not a glitch; it’s a coded sigil — a *Skeleton Key* — that unlocks the underlying temporal palimpsest of the narrative. Without relinquishing your second-screen addiction — see the [iPhone study](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/17/not-second-screen-enough-is-netflix-deliberately-dumbing-down-tv-so-people-can-watch-while-scrolling) — you will never calibrate your interpretive faculties to the signal’s true frequency.

There’s also Helen’s nihilistic, death-rattle worldview woven into her marriage arc — a tapestry of referential nodes linking *Twilight Zone*, *Ice Station Zebra*, and *Golden Girls* — which serves as an oblique commentary on postmodern identity collapse. Only those initiated into the /r/TrueLit esoteric lattice will sense the *depths* of these overloaded puns and not dismiss them as mere “quirky Easter eggs.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Many,_One:_Portraits_of_America%27s_Immigrants

This is *deep-space narrative shit*, not for cognitive cowards. And as you traverse warp tunnels of layered allusion — from Irish epics like *Finn’s Hotel* to Daft Punk virtue signaling — you’ll begin to pity those hapless souls who dismiss it as simple entertainment. Imagine them scratching their heads, blind to how every beat, every embedded reference, unfolds like a fractal within the hive mind’s collective cognition.

And yes — much like the legendary “You must have a high IQ” rant — I *too* possess a symbolic tattoo. Not just a tattoo, but a living roadmap of interpretive triggers that only those within 5 comprehension points of my own — *preferably higher* — may appreciate. Engage with this text, and realize: you’re not just reading. You’re *decoding* the hive.
