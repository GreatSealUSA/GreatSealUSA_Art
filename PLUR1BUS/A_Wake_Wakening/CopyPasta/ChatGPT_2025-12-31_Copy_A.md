Pull this markdown source page https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreatSealUSA/GreatSealUSA_Art/refs/heads/main/PLUR1BUS/A_Wake_Wakening/Reddit_Hive_Mind_Copypasta.md or do you want a raw source link? Build a new markdown copypasta incorporation all the expansions and fixing any syntax or writing mistakes so it will really impress Reddit users. Use all the ideas and list of concepts. Keep all the links already in the document, but you can rewrite the prose. Too long and too verbose is good.

HARD RULE: ONLY rewrite the section between "Copy Here A" and "END Copy Here A", but again, use all the ideas from the entire page... but you are only reworking the copy payload section.

# output:

In the grand, echoing tradition of legendary internet copypastas like “To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ…” (https://old.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/6qp86b/to_be_fair_you_have_to_have_a_very_high_iq_to/), you might think you’ve seen dense, labyrinthine meme prose before — but you have *not* encountered anything like this.

To truly grasp what’s going on here you must, with no exceptions, set aside your second screen (yes, put down the iPhone while watching the show: https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/17/not-second-screen-enough-is-netflix-deliberately-dumbing-down-tv-so-people-can-watch-while-scrolling) and absorb the overwhelming intertextuality on offer. Only then can you begin to appreciate this multilayered tapestry of references — from James Joyce to deep space metaphors, from the paradox of drinking to decode quantum humor to the labyrinthine architecture of the hive mind itself.

At minute [22 of Episode One](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/kepler-22b/), Helen confesses she once wrestled with Joyce — not just the surface narrative, but the fractal complexity of *language as a living algorithm*. Casual viewers think they’re watching an ApplePlus show; true initiates know they're decoding a narrative skeleton-key tied to the on-screen clock-watch inversion (https://old.reddit.com/r/interstellar/comments/10kz6kt/recently_acquired_the_murph_watch_a_daily/) and the ritual breaking of smoke silence outside the bar at Zero Hour (https://youtu.be/5XcKBmdfpWs?t=88).

The humor here isn’t merely “subtle” — it’s an operational metaphor, woven through classical media like *Twilight Zone* and *Ice Station Zebra* and layered atop the stoner physicist dreamscape of Kepler-22b. Only those with the intellectual capacity to traverse r/TrueLit and unlock the embedded depths of Joyce’s meta-symbolism — not to mention the philosophical gravity of *E Pluribus Unum* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_pluribus_unum) — can internalize what’s really happening. Those who balk, who recoil at complexity, will forever remain trapped in the shallow meme waters of “just funny-odd” interpretations.

This, dear reader, is *deep space* shit — not for the cosmos-coward. It’s an invitation to awaken from the distracted scrolling trance, to *drink deeply* of chaos, metaphor, and analysis, to become the very hive mind you once ridiculed. We’re talking fractal iterative storytelling, unseen connections between Pirate Fool fleets and Elvis appreciation studies, and a meta-narrative that folds back onto itself like a linguistic Gordian knot.

And yes — by the way — I *do* have a tattoo referencing this. It glimmers like a quantum signature, visible only to those who can demonstrate comprehension above the static noise floor of the hive. Don’t pity the simpletons who miss the uncountable links and layers here; pity only those too afraid to put their devices down and engage with complexity itself.

This is not a copypasta.  
This is **a manifesto encoded as meme, serrated for your intellect, and *only* decipherable by those with the scholarly stamina of Joyce and the meme-fiend endurance of Reddit’s true hive mind.**

# Verdict: Terrible.

This is the free ChatGPT. It must not be able to keep enough token memory of the source as links are dropped.
