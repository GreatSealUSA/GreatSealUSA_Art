# Fiction On The Wall

Fiction, Fiction, On the Wall, who lives in fiction, most of all?

Carol:    
Fiction, Fiction   
Cache Cache     

Did you ever? Did you ever dream of a suicde pill, and wake up home?   
No bears in that hive mind?  

"Did you ever lay on ice?" - on a bed of ice?

* The title of The Who's song "Cache Cache" is French for "hide-and-seek". The song, which appears on their 1981 album *Face Dances*, uses the term to describe a relationship in which people are hiding things from each other. Face Dances is also a metaphor for the body dances of the hive mind.

Don't swagger in there with a bazooka or a tank or atom bomb.

Carol isn't just boozing... she is also taking drugs, Xanex or something.  Her title of her unpublished book is "Bitter". She is not independent, she freaks out when the electric grid goes out and she can't watch electronic media (she is a book author, paper still works). She microwaves her food, she forages at the grocery store. No way could she have dug that grave alone. She drinks her coffee not rustic black, but Oat Milk. She hires a maid service to clean her house before she arrives home.

She promotes piracy, invades a retail book store to reshuffle the deck. But she doesn't like it when society (other minds) reshuffle the deck, pirate minds, plunder minds (her words "mind-fucking"). She telephones management to complain. She gets in manager faces and makes a scene. 

Skeptical of airline pilots, but not loaded weapons. Carol does not think a real weapon is a real weapon. Anyone who is taught gun safety says you always assume it is a loaded gun. Clearly her pirate book research she knows this kind of shit publishing 4 books. 

The hive mind even confronts Carol at the front door when handing her the Chekhov's gun that *she is being warned again that free thinkers can harm* and that sarcasm-poisoning / irony-poisoning isn't smart. She invites a stranger into her house... yet she thinks they are out to harm her. EDIT: She lives in New Mexico, the very state of New Mexico where an actor making a fiction story thought a gun was not loaded and killed a person. Bonanza Creek Ranch outside Santa Fe.

She is not  living in the reality. A scientific thinker would examine the loaded gun and analyze it independent of any dialog. You study the evidence, not just take people at their word ([Finnegans Wake Babel Overload](https://youtu.be/WoiJVkdDbOo?t=127)),or make an ass with *communications assumptions*. 

How many of the 900 million who died were terrible people or self-harm gave up?

Carol lives as a fiction author sucking down Golden Girls fiction TV, living the high life middle class dual income no children booze cruise jet set life. She won't even "come out of the Bitter closet" (pupa) to her fandom about her book character. Do her fans know she has a wife? I doubt it.

None of her secrets are worthy of secrets. What's the DUI story, Carol?
