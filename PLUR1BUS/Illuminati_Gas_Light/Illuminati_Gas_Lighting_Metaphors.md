# Illuminati Gas Lighting Metaphors 

CONTEXT ASSERTION: Carol and the Northern Lights visit with Helen. Lighting in gas form, like neon gas in a tube for home lighting. Or like Vegas neon lighting gas tubes. The metaphor of "neo Nobel gas lights". The Northern society / Northern Hemisphere / lighting. Air Force One metaphors. Great Seal Illunati banaltiy gas-lighting metaphors.

>  someone who isn't "blinded by the lights"

Vegas lights metaphors. 

It really seems to go both ways. The other 12 have formed "Carol anonymous" support group, and the hivemind flees now when she shows up in Vegas and in her home city. She is a light too bright for everyone. Only one person seems to be seeking her out and left his storage unit radio shack...

Carol lit a cigarette at the Zero Hour and they drew big attention to her being a non-smoker when the world burned down.
