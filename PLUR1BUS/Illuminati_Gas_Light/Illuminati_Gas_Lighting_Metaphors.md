# Illuminati Gas Lighting Metaphors 

CONTEXT ASSERTION: Carol and the Northern Lights visit with Helen. Lighting in gas form, like neon gas in a tube for home lighting. Or like Vegas neon lighting gas tubes. The metaphor of "neo Nobel gas lights". The Northern society / Northern Hemisphere / lighting. Air Force One metaphors.

Vegas lights metaphors. 

It really seems to go both ways. The other 12 have formed "Carol anonymous" support group, and the hivemind flees now when she shows up in Vegas and in her home city. She is a light too bright for everyone. Only one person seems to be seeking her out and left his storage unit radio shack...

Carol lit a cigarette at the Zero Hour and they drew big attention to her being a non-smoker when the world burned down.

"If you show up at The Washington Post or New Republic sites, where there's an article that's critical of Russia, and you see that there are 200 comments that sound like they were written by 12-year-olds, then you just don't bother to comment," she says.  "You don't participate. It's a way of just driving discussion away completely," she adds.
