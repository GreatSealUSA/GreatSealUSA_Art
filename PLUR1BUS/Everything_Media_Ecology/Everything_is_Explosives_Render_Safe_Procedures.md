# Everything is Explosives Render Safe Procedures

Context assertions / reminders

* Film / cinema: "The Hurt Locker (2008) follows elite U.S. Army bomb squad Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) in Iraq, focusing on his reckless thrill-seeking and addiction to the adrenaline of defusing improvised explosive devices (IEDs), clashing with teammates Sanborn & Eldridge, and exploring the psychological toll of combat, ultimately showing James' inability to leave the "hurt locker" of war behind for normal life. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, it's known for its visceral tension and realistic portrayal of EOD work, though critics note its procedural inaccuracies highlight the mental battle rather than technical detail."

* Film / cinema: "A House of Dynamite is a 2025 thriller by Kathryn Bigelow about an unattributed nuclear missile heading for Chicago, focusing on the frantic 18 minutes as U.S. leaders, from the President (Idris Elba) down, scramble to decide on a response, highlighting the flawed nuclear deterrence system, immense pressure on the President, and potential for catastrophic mistakes, all while underscoring the real-world dangers of nuclear stockpiles and the power held by a few individuals. The film explores the chaos, conflicting advice, and impossible choices in a nuclear crisis, showing that even with robust systems, accidents and misjudgments are possible, leading to real-world calls for reform in nuclear command and control."

* Large Language models, all human writings, all books, all written languages, all translations are being cooked into an intelligence information system. bible verse John 1:1 of the Levant 2,000 years ago is being realized with resources beyond The Manhattan Project, this is an arms race of linguistics commandments, John 1 : One one poetry going viral arms race.

* "Explosives Render Safe Procedures (RSPs) are systematic, specialized methods used by EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) experts to neutralize or control explosive devices (UXO, IEDs, etc.) without causing unintended detonation, involving risk assessment, area isolation, and using tools like disruptors to sever circuits or applying controlled burning/detonation for destruction, all while protecting personnel and the public. Key steps focus on recognizing hazards, retreating, reporting, and then applying techniques like remote disruption or controlled incineration, often using robotics and specific equipment to safely interrupt the device's functions."

# Disarming Fandoms

{ Quran, Torah, Bible } fandoms. The bad-ass science fiction Breaking Bad / Saul characters in those stories.

* One perfect book. **One, and ONLY one, perfect book** fandom warfare. 

Assertion: PLUR1BUS Book store opening, book tour, book fandom, book arranging on airport public display, Carol's unpublished book *work in progress* of Bitter Pupa, marriage of book promoter and book author, book piracy and fantasy *retcon* storytelling themes abound.

    * JOSEPH CAMPBELL: But in **the Bible, eternity withdraws, and nature is corrupt, nature has fallen**. In biblical thinking, we live in exile.

    * BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut — by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It [strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace_in_the_Global_Village) when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?

    * CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for **the future** (1987, published 1988).

    * MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?

    * CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

    * MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.

    * CAMPBELL: That’s what the [Great Seal](/) is all about.

# New Mexico Atomic, Manhattan name, Atlanta John One One 

Atlanta critic of fandom of John 1:1     
Disarming the John 1:1 [troubles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkeDjLZMRRk)    

"The real problem is that through our scientific genius we've made of the world a neighborhood, but through our moral and spiritual genius we've failed to make of it a brotherhood. And the great danger facing us today is not so much the atomic bomb that was created by physical science. Not so much that atomic bomb that you can put in an aeroplane and drop on the heads of hundreds and thousands of people — as dangerous as that is. But the real danger confronting civilization today is that atomic bomb which lies in the hearts and souls of men, capable of exploding into the vilest of hate and into the most damaging selfishness — that's the atomic bomb that we've got to fear today. Problem is with the men. Within the heart and the souls of men. That is the real basis of our problem."

We have been sitting on this hive mind truth of mob mentality. And we have not disarmed MAGA, "hearts and souls of men, capable of exploding into the vilest of hate and into the most damaging selfishness"

Manhattan Project, New Mexico USA       

"The B61-13 would be far more destructive. A visual representation created using Nukemap, an online tool created by historian of science and nuclear technology Alex Wellerstein, shows that a B61-13 bomb exploding over New York City at maximum yield would completely destroy a significant portion of **Manhattan** and melt the skin of those miles away from the initial blast."

... *Everything is Explosives Render Safe Procedures* ...

*  B61-13 ... "Estimated Warhead Weight: The internal nuclear device is speculated by some sources to weigh about 290 pounds (130 kg), which is a significant portion of the total weight, but this is an unofficial estimate and includes non-fissile parts of the warhead assembly."
