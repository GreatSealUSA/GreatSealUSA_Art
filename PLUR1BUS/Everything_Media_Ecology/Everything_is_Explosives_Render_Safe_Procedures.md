# Everything is Explosives Render Safe Procedures

Context assertions / reminders

* Film / cinema: "The Hurt Locker (2008) follows elite U.S. Army bomb squad Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) in Iraq, focusing on his reckless thrill-seeking and addiction to the adrenaline of defusing improvised explosive devices (IEDs), clashing with teammates Sanborn & Eldridge, and exploring the psychological toll of combat, ultimately showing James' inability to leave the "hurt locker" of war behind for normal life. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, it's known for its visceral tension and realistic portrayal of EOD work, though critics note its procedural inaccuracies highlight the mental battle rather than technical detail."

* Film / cinema: "A House of Dynamite is a 2025 thriller by Kathryn Bigelow about an unattributed nuclear missile heading for Chicago, focusing on the frantic 18 minutes as U.S. leaders, from the President (Idris Elba) down, scramble to decide on a response, highlighting the flawed nuclear deterrence system, immense pressure on the President, and potential for catastrophic mistakes, all while underscoring the real-world dangers of nuclear stockpiles and the power held by a few individuals. The film explores the chaos, conflicting advice, and impossible choices in a nuclear crisis, showing that even with robust systems, accidents and misjudgments are possible, leading to real-world calls for reform in nuclear command and control."

* Large Language models, all human writings, all books, all written languages, all translations are being cooked into an intelligence information system. bible verse John 1:1 of the Levant 2,000 years ago is being realized with resources beyond The Manhattan Project, this is an arms race of linguistics commandments, John 1 : One one poetry going viral arms race.

* "Explosives Render Safe Procedures (RSPs) are systematic, specialized methods used by EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) experts to neutralize or control explosive devices (UXO, IEDs, etc.) without causing unintended detonation, involving risk assessment, area isolation, and using tools like disruptors to sever circuits or applying controlled burning/detonation for destruction, all while protecting personnel and the public. Key steps focus on recognizing hazards, retreating, reporting, and then applying techniques like remote disruption or controlled incineration, often using robotics and specific equipment to safely interrupt the device's functions."

# New Mexico Atomic, Manhattan name, Atlanta John One One 

Atlanta critic of fandom of John 1:1     
Disarming the John 1:1 troubles    

"The real problem is that through our scientific genius we've made of the world a neighborhood, but through our moral and spiritual genius we've failed to make of it a brotherhood. And the great danger facing us today is not so much the atomic bomb that was created by physical science. Not so much that atomic bomb that you can put in an aeroplane and drop on the heads of hundreds and thousands of people — as dangerous as that is. But the real danger confronting civilization today is that atomic bomb which lies in the hearts and souls of men, capable of exploding into the vilest of hate and into the most damaging selfishness — that's the atomic bomb that we've got to fear today. Problem is with the men. Within the heart and the souls of men. That is the real basis of our problem."
