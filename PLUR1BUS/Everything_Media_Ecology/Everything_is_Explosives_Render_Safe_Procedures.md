# Everything is Explosives Render Safe Procedures

Context assertions / reminders

* Film / cinema: "The Hurt Locker (2008) follows elite U.S. Army bomb squad Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) in Iraq, focusing on his reckless thrill-seeking and addiction to the adrenaline of defusing improvised explosive devices (IEDs), clashing with teammates Sanborn & Eldridge, and exploring the psychological toll of combat, ultimately showing James' inability to leave the "hurt locker" of war behind for normal life. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, it's known for its visceral tension and realistic portrayal of EOD work, though critics note its procedural inaccuracies highlight the mental battle rather than technical detail."

* Film / cinema: "A House of Dynamite is a 2025 thriller by Kathryn Bigelow about an unattributed nuclear missile heading for Chicago, focusing on the frantic 18 minutes as U.S. leaders, from the President (Idris Elba) down, scramble to decide on a response, highlighting the flawed nuclear deterrence system, immense pressure on the President, and potential for catastrophic mistakes, all while underscoring the real-world dangers of nuclear stockpiles and the power held by a few individuals. The film explores the chaos, conflicting advice, and impossible choices in a nuclear crisis, showing that even with robust systems, accidents and misjudgments are possible, leading to real-world calls for reform in nuclear command and control."

* "Explosives Render Safe Procedures (RSPs) are systematic, specialized methods used by EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) experts to neutralize or control explosive devices (UXO, IEDs, etc.) without causing unintended detonation, involving risk assessment, area isolation, and using tools like disruptors to sever circuits or applying controlled burning/detonation for destruction, all while protecting personnel and the public. Key steps focus on recognizing hazards, retreating, reporting, and then applying techniques like remote disruption or controlled incineration, often using robotics and specific equipment to safely interrupt the device's functions."
