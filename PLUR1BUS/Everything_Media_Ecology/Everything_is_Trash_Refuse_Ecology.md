# Rediscovering trash

All from the same slavage day. February 28, 1954

* "most damaging selfishness — that's the **atomic bomb** that we've got to fear today. Problem is with the men. Within the heart and the souls of men. That is the real basis of our problem." - Made in New Mexico Manhattan atomic bomb that Carol has as a checkov's loaded hand grenade.

* "Sometimes, you know, it's necessary to go backward in order to go forward. That's an analogy of life. I remember the other day I was driving out of New York City" - all right Son of murdered preacher, Junior, driving against the Deacons and Bishop don't sactify you - Finnegans Wake Deacons and Biships (Lesbians shipping relationships) / [Arch Bishops sanctifications](https://youtu.be/LzOl9FAqQgc?t=150).

* "My friends, all I'm trying to say is that if we are to go forward today, we've got to go back and rediscover some mighty precious values that we've left behind. That's the only way that we would be able to make of our world a **better world**, and to make of this world what God wants it to be and the real purpose and meaning of it."

* "The first principle of value that we need to rediscover is this: that all reality hinges on moral foundations. In other words, that this is a moral universe, and that there are moral laws of the universe just as abiding as the physical laws. I'm not so sure we all believe that." - Cosmic RNA light-years away
