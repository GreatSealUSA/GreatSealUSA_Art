# Rediscovering trash

All from the same slavage day. February 28, 1954

* "most damaging selfishness — that's the **atomic bomb** that we've got to fear today. Problem is with the men. Within the heart and the souls of men. That is the real basis of our problem." - Made in New Mexico Manhattan atomic bomb that Carol has as a checkov's loaded hand grenade.

* "Sometimes, you know, it's necessary to go backward in order to go forward. That's an analogy of life. I remember the other day I was driving out of New York City" - all right Son of murdered preacher, Junior, driving against the Deacons and Bishop don't sactify you - Finnegans Wake Deacons and Biships (Lesbians shipping relationships) / [Arch Bishops sanctifications](https://youtu.be/LzOl9FAqQgc?t=150). OPERA_A Out of NYC - MLK Jr is addressing the day of the expanding man. The shame of where we stand USA. It seems like only yesterday, while Elvis gamblers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyCDicG0tDs

* "My friends, all I'm trying to say is that if we are to go forward today, we've got to go back and rediscover some mighty precious values that we've left behind. That's the only way that we would be able to make of our world a **better world**, and to make of this world what God wants it to be and the real purpose and meaning of it."

* "The first principle of value that we need to rediscover is this: that all reality hinges on moral foundations. In other words, that this is a moral universe, and that there are moral laws of the universe just as abiding as the physical laws. I'm not so sure we all believe that." - Cosmic RNA light-years away

ToDo: Finn's Hotel 1923 work unpublished, like Carol's Bitter Woke Up book. "Deacons/Demon Deacons: This is the nickname for the sports teams of Wake Forest University. The name originated in 1923" - vs. Chrimson Tide.

More from Sunday February 28, 1954

* "It's not enough to know all about our philosophical and mathematical disciplines, but we've got to know the simple disciplines of being honest and loving and just with all humanity. If we don't learn it, we will destroy ourselves by the misuse of our own powers." - Hive mind doesn't lie according to Carol. And all of humanity, racism gone according to the Air Force One meetup.

* "The most dangerous type of atheism is not theoretical atheism, but practical atheism ... that's the most dangerous type. And the world, even the church, is filled up with people who pay lip service to God and not life service. And there is always a danger that we will make it appear externally that we believe in God when internally we don't. We say with our mouths that we believe in him, but we live with our lives like he never existed. That is the ever-present danger confronting religion." - Febraury 28, 2025. The Founding Fathers *do believe in god, but not ONLY Levant God*. The Great Seal of the USA is a chery-picking tool of all world science fiction stories, all fiction storytelling, not just the famous Levant science fiction trillogy of { Torah, Quran, Bible }. There is no "special relvelation" to the FOunding Fathers.

* "And I think, my friends, that that is the thing that has happened in America. That we have unconsciously left God behind. Now, we haven't consciously done it; we have unconsciously done it. You see, the text, you remember the text said that Jesus' parents went a whole day's journey not knowing that he wasn't with them. They didn't consciously leave him behind. It was unconscious; went a whole day and didn't even know it. It wasn't a conscious process." - Febraury 28, 2025. We left behind the Great Seal of the Untied States of America teaching too! *that god*, **Diesm / Diests**, cherry-picking from ANY science fiction or fiction story. ... ... ... "the entire philosophy the early republic was based upon. And how utterly deplorable and regrettable and terrible it is that all of this has been virtually totally forgotten by our days. And that we have held, The American People, have held in their very hands, handed to them by people like Franklin and Jefferson and all kinds of others... One of the most splendid treasures of spiritual philosophy - applicable to all manner of human purposes. And we have discarded it. And we are running around like beggars, the world over, picking up crumbs from every kind of anarchists, Marxists, this thing, fascists, this thing that thing, all over the world. All of which, put together, could never come close to the psychological spiritual wisdom that was given to us to begin with... and that we have simply forgotten about and thrown away. And how incredibly unfortunate and terrible this is." https://youtu.be/08R1kPdfrHA?t=4427 - Dr. Stephan A. Hoeller, year 1987

* "Since the rise of the Industrial Revolution in England, and then the invention of all of our gadgets and contrivances and all of the things and modern conveniences — we unconsciously left God behind. We didn't mean to do it. We just became so involved in getting our big bank accounts that we unconsciously forgot about God — we didn't mean to do it. We became so involved in getting our nice luxurious cars, and they're very nice, but we became so involved in it that it became much more convenient to ride out to the beach on Sunday afternoon than to come to church that morning. (Yes) It was an unconscious thing — we didn't mean to do it. We became so involved and fascinated by the intricacies of television that we found it a little more convenient to stay at home than to come to church. It was an unconscious thing — we didn't mean to do it." - February 28, 1954 - media ecology abounds! Television discussion 1954. Exactly what Vince Gilligan is saying in early year 2025 about bad-guy cheerleaders with big loads of money (Walter White) problems. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ohOibt3o7uU WGA about storytelling writng call for reformation.
