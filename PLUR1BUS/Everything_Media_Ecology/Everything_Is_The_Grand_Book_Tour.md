# Audience Fixated On 

Media ecology metaphors of real-world fixation of real-world media interfaces. https://youtu.be/_qP4aMglhGE?t=1861 ( "TWO PLANES ONE RUNWAY The 1991 LAX Disaster | Mayday: Air Disaster" ) ... Radio Shack listening metaphors abound, base station metaphors, New Mexico RNA signal Contact 78 seconds scanning metaphors abound. Carol *crashes* the world wide web / hive mind network / genocide events when she fixates on egoism and payback revenge for Helen's grinning / smiling death after Helen fell. Lots of intercourse dialog intercourse sex metaphros with Pirate Lady and crashing the ship / relationships. Audience "shippping" characters / etc. Fandom Breaking Bad real-wrold women getting death threats from Mr. White aspirational audience: https://old.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/14g2wp9/can_someone_explain_to_me_the_death_threats_anna/

Vince Gilligan is saying social meme audiences fixate on the aspirational aspects of bad guys. Darth Vader, Mr. White teaching the society https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ohOibt3o7uU  Fixated on self-harm to ABQ, chemistry dependencye, the booze bause chemical dependency of Carol that Mr. White cultivates. And the *getting pissed* smoke break at minute 22 in Episode One, the Funeral Wake of Walter White middle age book writing post-gradulate women pissed-off and boozed-up by drug makers / booze sellers. Walter White's toxic masculinity gravesite / grave they are pissing upon metaphorically. https://www.soapcentral.com/shows/silver-jack-s-saloon-pluribus-special-connection-breaking-bad-better-call-saul-fans-might-noticed

Fixated on terrible lawers, type casting the lead actress, "Saul is good, Saul is cool!!!" audience media fixations of being Truth Social consumers and not seeing the problem of Truth Social drug meme dealers. Opening Gauntlet against this thrown at start of year 2025: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ohOibt3o7uU
