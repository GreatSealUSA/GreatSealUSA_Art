# Audience Fixated On 

Media ecology metaphors of real-world fixation of real-world media interfaces. https://youtu.be/_qP4aMglhGE?t=1861 ( "TWO PLANES ONE RUNWAY The 1991 LAX Disaster | Mayday: Air Disaster" ) ... Radio Shack listening metaphors abound, base station metaphors, New Mexico RNA signal Contact 78 seconds scanning metaphors abound. Carol *crashes* the world wide web / hive mind network / genocide events when she fixates on egoism and payback revenge for Helen's grinning / smiling death after Helen fell. Lots of intercourse dialog intercourse sex metaphros with Pirate Lady and crashing the ship / relationships. Audience "shippping" characters / etc. Fandom Breaking Bad real-world women getting **death threats** from Mr. White aspirational audience members: https://old.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/14g2wp9/can_someone_explain_to_me_the_death_threats_anna/

Vince Gilligan is saying social meme audiences fixate on the aspirational aspects of bad guys. Darth Vader, Mr. White teaching the society https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ohOibt3o7uU  Fixated on self-harm to ABQ, chemistry dependencye, the booze bause chemical dependency of Carol that Mr. White cultivates. And the *getting pissed* smoke break at minute 22 in Episode One, the Funeral Wake of Walter White middle age book writing post-gradulate women pissed-off and boozed-up by drug makers / booze sellers. Walter White's toxic masculinity gravesite / grave they are pissing upon metaphorically. https://www.soapcentral.com/shows/silver-jack-s-saloon-pluribus-special-connection-breaking-bad-better-call-saul-fans-might-noticed

Fixated on terrible lawers, type casting the lead actress, "Saul is good, Saul is cool!!!" audience media fixations of being Truth Social consumers and not seeing the problem of Truth Social drug meme dealers. Opening Gauntlet against this thrown at start of year 2025: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ohOibt3o7uU

# Language Mockery

John 1:1 mockery

 Carol asks Zosia to translate into Sanskrit occurs in Episode 3 of the TV series Pluribus. During a meal, Carol asks Zosia how to say a toast in Sanskrit. Zosia tells Carol the word is "śubhamastu" (meaning "let good things happen" or a similar blessing), but Carol dismissively responds with "shoopy-shoop shoop" instead of making an effort to pronounce it correctly. 

The science fiction audience lessons from Luke Skywaker Ranch, published in year 1988, filmed by George Lucas:

"Now, I came to this idea of bliss **because in Sanskrit, which is the great spiritual language of the world**, there are three terms that represent the brink, the jumping-off place to the ocean of transcendence: Sat, Chit, Ananda. The word “Sat” means being. “Chit” means consciousness. “Ananda” means bliss or rapture. I thought, “I don’t know whether my consciousness is proper consciousness or not; I don’t know whether what I know of my being is my proper being or not; but I do know where my rapture is. So let me hang on to rapture, and that will bring me both my consciousness and my being.” I think it worked." - 1988, The Power of Myth

## Latin Language Mockery, "Pluribus"


Carol being the *only one* in the world who speaks English as a first language. Episode Two asserts this before Air Force One meataphors.

In the "Telemachus" and "Lotus Eaters" episodes of Ulysses, the characters observe the Latin Mass and the perceived effect of the language on the congregation: 

* "Good idea the Latin. Stupefies them first"

&nbsp;

Forest for Trees, Context Assertion: { Minute 22 / Kepler 22 } Episode One Zero Hour, in a *Public House* before the singsong begins, Helen delivers a post-doctorate thesis on James Joyce authoring. The world ends at minute 22.
