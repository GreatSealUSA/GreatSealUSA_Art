Skywalker Ranch lessons for science fiction audiences, published in 1988:

BILL MOYERS: That would explain the other inscription down there, "Novus Ordo Sedorum."

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: "A new order of the world." This is a new order of the world. And the saying above, "Annuit Coeptis," means "He has smiled on our accomplishments" or "our activities."

MOYERS: He --

CAMPBELL: He, the eye, what is represented by the eye. Reason. **In Latin you wouldn't have to say "he," it could be "it" or "she" or "he."** But the divine power has smiled on our doings.

* OPERA_A: video... "Within the limits of British decency". Pluribus, Lyrics: "I am **he** as you are **he**, as you are me and **we are all** together" - year 1967 - crying https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og-yjQGzIS8 - Carol authors John 1:1, in the beginning the egg womb was fertilized. Carol can wrote John 1:1 or Paul or Ringo Star. We The People originate the hive mind "God" above. Him / He / I am Him / We are He or She.

# Episode One "We is Us"

Pronoun shift, "We is Us", Pluribus.

We The People.

Carol and Helen the lesbian marriage that has Carol's frozen reproductive eggs / cells on ice.

She is my wife, we are married, we are intimate, we want to have children one day.

Outlawing and punishing this freedom of choice is a core concern in Christian Bible USA society. Levant science fiction trilogy fandom (Torah, Bible, Quran, Book of Mormon, etc). Not allowing homosexual sexual relationships. Not on television, not on Apple iPhone, not on Apple iPad, not for any children to see Pluribus TV from Apple.

* CONTEXT ASSERTION: Minute Twenty Two of Episode One of Pluribus. After presenting her post-doctorate thesis to Carol about James Joyce's book Finnegans Wake, carol steps outside at the zero hour. She is touching a social media touch device on a USA touchy subject of transgender Pirate Lady / Pirate Man character shipping. Virtue signaling true story from profit-seeking and disclosing to the audience the inspiration and marriage details of the writers. Touching the third rail of social media society on a lit touch device - that is when Helen falls and ultimately dies on top of Walter White's grave site.

The Apple Tree of Knowledge of depicting "we" joining, *the joining*, of two women at the lips and kissing. Romance gender topics of profit-seeking romance book publishing. 

Forbidden images of love, forbidden gender joining depictions, forbidden thoughts, forbidden desires.

# Christmas Day: He is Born

# Son of the Father, He is my Father

You will be Judged by Him. He is the father above in outer space. the male father in his male role rules over Judgement Day. These are the values in the USA.

Except they are *not* the values of the Great Seal. Jesus is not mentioned in the Constitution, the Decleration of Independence, or the Free Mason Great Seal of the United States of America.

&nbsp;

# Title of this page: Everything is Pronouns

the show is all about pronouns.

We, us, them, the non-person Native Americans, the non-person imported black slaves from Africa. 

In Episode Eight, carol said she saw a buffalo. Minute x

This invokes a conversation and teachings about the word "Pluribus" about the meaning of the hive mind proposal of the Founding Fathers of the united Stats of America.

Yes, men, "fathers", who came from Bible Torah Quran. But these men cross an ocean. These men met native american people who had never heard of "Jesus Chirst" or Enlgish language or writing.

Manhattan New York isn't just a made-up word, it is the Manhattan tribe of people who lived before English or THE Bible ever TOUCHED NORTH America. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenape

&nbsp;

# Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo 

ToDo; James Joyce language analysis of the word Buffalo link

Carol didn't just name-drop any animal that she encountered. With her lesbian Pirate Lady trans-gender change in her Chapter One writing in Pluribus Episode Eight.

Please re-read this entire page from the top. "We is Us" episode one. marriage, writing, books.

Not just any book, a 1988 book about science fiction and the founding fathers meaning of the Great Seal of the United States of America Latin and images of art. Carol says the Buffalo might eat the art work.

What if the Buffalo were to eat up the Bible art science fiction an leave behind the Great Seal of the United States of America art work.

Buffalo have been on USA coins. But Jesus and Mohammad and Moses have not been on USA coins.

Carol's pronoun change of her Pirate man / Pirate Lady and buffalo art discussion does not lead one to just any book. But a science fiction nonfiction teaching book.

&nbsp;

# The Power of Myth 

The Power of Vince Gilligan's storytelling and *casting* out his stories.

ToDo: Link WGA "casting" line

&nbsp;

BILL MOYERS: The Indians addressed **the buffalo as “thou,”** an object of reverence.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: The Indians addressed all of life as a “thou” — the trees, the stones, everything. You can address anything as a “thou,” and if you do it, you can feel the change in your own psychology. The **ego that sees a “thou” is not the same ego that sees an “it.” And when you go to war with people, the problem of the newspapers is to turn those people into “its.”**

BILL MOYERS: This happens in **marriage, too**, doesn’t it? And happens with children, too.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Sometimes the “thou” turns into an “it,” and you don’t **know what the relationship is**. 

&nbsp;

Vince Gilligan mentioned "Darth Vader" by name. The Father, the man, the pronoun inheritance. Where this audience nonfiction education book originated.

"On Day One of his second term, President Donald Trump ordered the federal bureaucracy to "recognize two sexes," which quickly translated into memos telling staff to strip pronouns from signatures; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission even bragged about deleting its internal Microsoft 365 pronoun feature. The Air Force briefly banned pronouns outright—then reversed itself when lawyers waved the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, which bars the Pentagon from either requiring or banning pronouns in official correspondence. Inside the same government, pronouns were, within weeks, both prohibited and protected."

Content ::: ======================

The right’s refrain on pronoun use is parental authority and freedom from compelled speech. "Parents have the right to direct the upbringing, education, and health care of their children," said Alliance Defending Freedom after a Virginia district paid $575,000 to settle with French teacher Peter Vlaming, fired for avoiding a student’s pronouns; the group called it proof schools cannot "force" speech that violates faith.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, turned that into marching orders, demanding the state investigate Bellaire High and urging a ban on "transitioning" students by using new names and pronouns. "No parent should have to endure this," he wrote.

# Season One Pluribus Christmas Day

I think it can not possibly be over-stated that we have a crisis in USA.

Democracy does not work without compassion and love.    
Democracy does not work when hate is prized.   
"Hate thy enemy" destroys a democracy. Enemy seeking hate seeking.    
"Hate thy neighbor" destroys a democracy. Prizing of hate.    

Christmas Day 2025, what's the point when We The People made social media society a cesspool of hate and dehumanization. Anti-love, anti-compassion, anti-goodness. The Bible is a science fiction story like Hamlet from William Shakespeare is science fiction with "Force Ghost" character, Hamlet's Ghost. Cherry picking is fine, but why is it hat Bible fandom in North America is nut-picking and not cherry-picking verses { Matthew 22:39, Matthew 5:44 } in year 2025 and going into 250 years July 4, 2026? Why are *We is Us* Pluribus people prizing hate when they cherry-pick from the Levant science fiction trilogy in year 2025? Is hate supposed to be fun and enjoyable?

Democracy does not work without compassion and love.

Carol: "All the brains in the world, and you can't navigate a fuckin' pronoun?"

* This line has **VERY deep meaning about the Latin** word "Pluribus" and associated source. The USA Founding Fathers teachings vs. Levant "He / Him" (Christmas Day ending season one) *pronouns*. [Year 1988 "Power of Myth"](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/) filmed by George Lucas, lessons for science fiction (Star Wars / Hollywood) fandoms:

   * JOSEPH CAMPBELL: "A new order of the world." This is a new order of the world. And the saying above, "Annuit Coeptis," means "He has smiled on our accomplishments" or "our activities."

   * BILL MOYERS: He --

   * CAMPBELL: He, the eye, what is represented by the eye. Reason. **In Latin** you wouldn't have to say "he," it could be "it" or "she" or "he." But the divine power has smiled on our doings.
