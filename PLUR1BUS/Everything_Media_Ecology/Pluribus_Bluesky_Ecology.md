After Episode Seven, day of Episode Eight. 2025-12-18  

"Everyone's making a fuss about #Pluribus, but I have the same feeling I had when I watched Better Call Saul the first time: it's **long, and nothing happens**. Things will probably accelerate too by the end, and I may like it the second time I watch it... Who knows?"

"I don't understand the Carol hate. Like she's being very rational"

I don't think hate is ever good. That said, Carol is a heavy boozer and drinking with a DUI device on her car in the show. (in response to "being very rational")

HASHTAGS: The #WalterWhite fandom has some very strange hate behaviors towards #women characters. #AnnaGunn
