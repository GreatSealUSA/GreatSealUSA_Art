There are many different types of mental illness and you’re insulting millions of people, including many on Lemmy, right now by implying that their condition means that they are MAGAs. Good job. Very sensitive.

In your case though, my guess is stimulant abuse. I’ve seen this type of posting before. Amphetamines cause a unique blend of dunning kruegar and inane rambling that’s easy to spot if you know where to look.

No, this is teaching about Free Masons, year 1776 stuff on year 2026. The Founding Fathers of the Untied States of America symbolism  art vs. Fox News HDTV of October 7 (Putin's Birthday) year 1996.

Lemmy meme addiction: "public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions"     
*Lemmy* technology, meme mill entertainments

"For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody."
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111
