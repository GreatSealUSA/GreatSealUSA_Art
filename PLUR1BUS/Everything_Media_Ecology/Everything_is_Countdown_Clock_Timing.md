# Minute 22 Breaking Bad / Minute 22 Pluribus

Minute 22 is when walter toys with water on fire contemplating. And picks up, media ecology, cordless phone land line (POTS) to call Hank and start learning about chemistry drug making *legal side*, how to do the crime-side.

Symbolism of fishing, casting matches of flame, fire and brimstone. Hell casting. Matthew 4:19 fishing for greed motivations and defeating The Law, defeating goodness with fire-casting into the lake of fire.

OPERA_A All the way to Fire Lake, who wants to break the cancer news (ecology of spreading information, bad news) at age 50 cake cutting / threshold crossing. That Walt's run off to Fire Lake.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wisED81Wbog Walt wants to play those 8's and aces... long-shot gamble. He's made the free will choice to head out to Fire Lake. The Call to Adventure of Finnegans Anti-Wake, the leadership of bad breaking the audience / RFK Jr set into motion as virus outbreak leader by "bad guys are cook, fire is cool" (Stephen King The Stand, New Mexico Manhattan Project "big fire" is cool!)

OPERA_A Fire into the water hole, if it was the Finnegan "Water of LIfe" from Pluribus... and the difficult of water in the remote areas of New Mexico... swimming pool metaphors. Really exuasted as I write this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKDlP-WQCOU

* "I had to **quadruple-check** this because I had not seen any official announcement about this from Apple itself, and the web app doesn’t list it. However, both the iPhone app and the TV app say that the Pluribus hour-long season 1 finale is now airing on Wednesday, December 24. However, with the way Apple TV does things, that actually means Tuesday, December 23 at 9 PM ET. I don’t know why they do that. Previously, it was set to air on December 26, which would have technically been the night of Christmas Day itself"

[Falling back](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/spring-forward-fall-back.html), like Carol *Fell* Back after declaring Tim's ladder fall a benchmark divining stick at the Zero Hour.    
"The winter solstice in New Mexico occurs on Sunday, December 21, 2025, at 8:03 am MST" 

Christmas Bible verse Matthew 2:2 / Baby bump, Kepler alignments. 

We are digging around in inception metaphors here, March 25 targeting for some science fiction story retcons. Give or take 22 Kepler hours, 22 Minutes of Episode One post-doctorate thesis tuning. "Two solstices occur annually, around 20–22 June and 20–22 December." - can we [focus in on Bloomsday leaping 1132 gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday) equations??

It's all so encoded! 78 seconds of RNA tracks of whack! OPERA_A Is Carol boozing again? [Is there a Star for Kepler 22?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm5xyA6keFY) Fell down hard, did Helen?
