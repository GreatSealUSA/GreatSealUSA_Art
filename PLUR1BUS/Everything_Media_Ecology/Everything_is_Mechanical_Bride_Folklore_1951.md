""Third from the Sun" is the fourteenth episode of the American television anthology series The Twilight Zone. It is based on a short story of the same name by Richard Matheson which first appeared in the first issue of the magazine Galaxy Science Fiction in October 1950."

"Will Sturka, a scientist who works at a military base, has been producing a great number of H-bombs"d to believe there are people living on the alien world where they're headed. Riden points out on the ship's viewer their mysterious destination, 11 million miles away—the third planet from the Sun, called "Earth""

# Carol: Pod People

Episode Two (released along with, paired Episode One Pilot)   
"Meanwhile, everybody everywhere else has turned into some kind of fucking pod person. Right?" ... "I… I’ve seen this movie. We’ve all seen this movie. And we know it does not end well."

## Casket people: Funeral Wake

So the body of Helen is given a lot of screen time in Episode One. Emphasis on the physical body.

Helen, minute 22 of Episode One, in a show about Kepler 22...

James Joyce's Finnegans Wake book is introduced as graduate work by Helen.

This is at the very time of "00:00:00:00" countdown that the show keeps emphasizing time in every episode. There is even microphone tapping, a storytelling technique, that audience should really pay attention to this scene at minute 22.

Helen dies the same way as Tim Finnegan. She falls backwards and her brain is damaged. You can see in Helen's eyes that blood is pooling and they are turning dark. And then Carol finds out the next day that "dead" Helen is not really dead, all her memories and experiences are in a magical outer-space place. Is Helen really dead? That is the story of Tim Finnegan that James Joyce expounds upon.

# Title of this page

* "In his 1951 book The Mechanical Bride, Marshall McLuhan argues that advertising and mass media reduce women to fragmented, objectified "parts" or "replaceable parts," much like components of a machine. The title alludes to the way women are marketed as pre-packaged, inanimate objects designed to fulfill male fantasies and desires, rather than as whole human beings with unique selves."

* "McLuhan's analysis includes observations about how women's body parts are presented in media. He notes that "legs, like busts, are power points" used as a "success kit" rather than for genuine expression. He also describes legs as "display objects" detached from the individual, contributing to a culture of "replaceable parts". This ultimately contributes to a view of the human body as a "love-machine" focused on mechanical thrills."

CAMPBELL: Well, I wouldn’t be one to say. It’s a very mysterious thing, that electric thing that happens, and then the agony that can follow. The troubadours celebrate the agony of the love...
