# Vince Gilligan: 1950

""Third from the Sun" is the fourteenth episode of the American television anthology series The Twilight Zone. It is based on a short story of the same name by Richard Matheson which first appeared in the first issue of the magazine Galaxy Science Fiction in October 1950."

"Will Sturka, a scientist who works at a military base, has been producing a great number of H-bombs"d to believe there are people living on the alien world where they're headed. Riden points out on the ship's viewer their mysterious destination, 11 million miles away—the third planet from the Sun, called "Earth""

# Carol: Pod People 1956

Episode Two (released along with, paired Episode One Pilot)   
"Meanwhile, everybody everywhere else has turned into some kind of fucking pod person. Right?" ... "I… I’ve seen this movie. We’ve all seen this movie. And we know it does not end well."

* "This 1956 science-fiction classic, and its subsequent remakes, tells the story of an alien invasion where plant-based lifeforms (pods) create emotionless duplicates of humans, effectively replacing them and erasing their individuality. The term "pod people" became a common slang expression referring to these duplicates. The creators of Pluribus explicitly used the film as a major reference point for the show's hive-mind concept"

## Casket people: Funeral Wake

So the body of Helen is given a lot of screen time in Episode One. Emphasis on the physical body.

Helen, minute 22 of Episode One, in a show about Kepler 22...

James Joyce's Finnegans Wake book is introduced as graduate work by Helen.

This is at the very time of "00:00:00:00" countdown that the show keeps emphasizing time in every episode. There is even microphone tapping, a storytelling technique, that audience should really pay attention to this scene at minute 22.

Helen dies the same way as Tim Finnegan. She falls backwards and her brain is damaged. You can see in Helen's eyes that blood is pooling and they are turning dark. And then Carol finds out the next day that "dead" Helen is not really dead, all her memories and experiences are in a magical outer-space place. Is Helen really dead? That is the story of Tim Finnegan that James Joyce expounds upon.

Year 1923, "Finn's Hotel" book

# Title of this page

* "In his 1951 book The Mechanical Bride, Marshall McLuhan argues that advertising and mass media reduce women to fragmented, objectified "parts" or "replaceable parts," much like components of a machine. The title alludes to the way women are marketed as pre-packaged, inanimate objects designed to fulfill male fantasies and desires, rather than as whole human beings with unique selves."

* "McLuhan's analysis includes observations about how women's body parts are presented in media. He notes that "legs, like busts, are power points" used as a "success kit" rather than for genuine expression. He also describes legs as "display objects" detached from the individual, contributing to a culture of "replaceable parts". This ultimately contributes to a view of the human body as a "love-machine" focused on mechanical thrills."

Back to 1951 book

* "Ours is the first age in which many thousands of the best-trained individual minds have made it a full-time business to get inside **the collective public mind**," McLuhan writes in his preface to the book. He believes the modern "helpless state engendered by prolonged mental rutting is the effect of many ads and **much entertainment** alike."

The "Collective Public Mind" is another phrase for Pluribus of the USA Great Seal Latin proposal.

### Distributist

"That passionate dream of unlimited monopolistic power still carries over into the new age of relativity physics. But the dream of relativity physics is not of centralism but of pluralism. It is not-centralist but distributist in the matter of power and control. And to see this new vision at work side by side with the old one is to permit the reformer a sure method of diagnosis and therapeutic suggestion. It permits the reformer to co-operate with the same forces that have produced the disease, in order to point the way to health. Thus, as passivity becomes extreme in the bulk of society, a sizable segment of citizens detaches itself from the dream-locked majority." - Mechanical Bride, year 1951, Page 22

* "Pluralism is the concept that multiple, diverse groups, beliefs, and powers coexist and thrive in a society, emphasizing dialogue, mutual respect, and shared understanding rather than assimilation or mere tolerance, especially in politics where power is dispersed among various interest groups, and in philosophy, where multiple truths or realities are acknowledged. It's about active engagement with differences, seeing diversity as a strength for solving complex problems, and ensuring various viewpoints influence public life." - Google Search summary 2025-12-29 morning USA

# Pluribus Assertions

1. Ravi (Laxmi's son): child, he is 9 years old. Ravi is not immune and has been "Joined". She loudly makes the point that her child is still her child because the body is the same. Physical body. Episode Two at the Air Force One (POTUS Seal) in-person physical meetings. The mechanical child body parts...

Baby dolls, toys, are a common global experience. 

Some observations of where ideas come from, Earthbound ideas and ritual experiences.

* "Cannibalism was practiced by some groups in New Guinea, often as part of funerary rites, such as among the Fore people. This endocannibalism (eating members of one's own group) was considered a mark of respect for the deceased."

* "While discussions referencing Joseph Campbell's The Power of Myth mention a gruesome ritual involving children and consumption, this specific account appears to be unsubstantiated or highly distorted compared to authoritative sources on New Guinea cannibalism." - I mean, let's be serious here... Campbell did put myth into the stories of mythology. Inception and all. The [Chief Seattle story (Page 62)](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA42&dq=%22Chief+Seattle+wrote+a+marvelous+letter+in+reply.+His+letter+expresses+the+moral,+really,+of+our+whole+discussion.%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X) that Bill Moyers really seemed to like should be an Errata on the Wikipedia page of the Power of Myth 1988 book. Once, long ago, I think I added it, somewhere in that Wiki page history. https://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/fake.html
   * Well, what do you know, still active. I was a professional technical editor in my early professional years. IBM OS/2 Microsoft OS/2 books. I quoted the 1988 book on Reddit comments section and another Reddit peer user kindly informed me it was bullshit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell_and_the_Power_of_Myth#Errata Took me 15 minutes on Wikipedia to find my revision https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Campbell_and_the_Power_of_Myth&oldid=315509362 "14:08, 22 September 2009 (Added section on error related to Chief Seattle Letter)" - somewhere on that date Reddit has a comment that corrected my book quote. This active mythology and media ecology learning of newspaper vs. books vs. Reddit social media vs. Facebook social media while living in Austin, Texas was my lead up to December 16, 2009 Arab Spring prediction and all of year 2010 focused on north Africa (Great Seal pyramid location). To my eventual (physical) travel to Africa after Ramadan 2010. This is a folklore page.. of media ecology...
   * Exercise for someone on the World Wide Web is to expand the Errata page on Power of Myth 1988 Wikipedia page that the ritual of puberty eating children story is high exaggerated by Campbell.
