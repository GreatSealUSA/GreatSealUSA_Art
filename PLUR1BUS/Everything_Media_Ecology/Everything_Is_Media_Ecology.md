# Soylent Green

The author in post-production interviews can't spell out Soylent Green before Episode One even airs. That's too obvioius. But the author can say "The Twilight Zone". October 2, 1959, to June 19, 1964. Soylent Green is year 1973.

# Dear Screenplay Writers, Dear We The People:

At the peak of media fame, at the peak of power to create anything desired, given *two full season green-lighting from Apple, A in the Alphabet of wealth production* this is what was spoken.

The Influencer of Google Search:    
"In February 2025, Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan made headlines for his WGA award speech, urging writers to create more heroes and fewer aspirational villains, as real-life bad guys were "running amok," feeling his own iconic antiheroes like Walter White had become too influential and even "aspirational" for audiences. He called for a shift back to classic, morally good characters like George Bailey, feeling media's villain obsession was sending the wrong message, a sentiment that sparked much discussion about media's role in shaping perceptions of "bad guys"." - Google A.I. 2025-12-09 USA morning.

A new media ecology of peer to peer showwriting / showrunning. The gauntlet has been thrown down to peer writiers from on-high respected writer.

# This is in the Face of The Wind 

This is a pirate ship facing into the wind. Into the prevealing atttiude as Martin Luther King Jr. said about morality. [Against the *hive mind* of playing on the F.M. radio ecology, swore that it would never end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vRsEC65NTA). In the very heart of the Reddit Twitch media hive mind. The years roll slowly past, and Carol found herself alone, surrounded by strangers that previous used to be friends. 

1. Reddit Hive mind, NOTE THE DATE, February 7, 2013 Reddit posting. Not this month,not Pluribus, but Reddit termnology of bee hive metaphors. https://old.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/181smu/is_the_reddit_hive_mind_wrong_about_video_games/

2. Note the TOPIC about media ecology of that February 7, 2013 Reddit posting. https://old.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/181smu/is_the_reddit_hive_mind_wrong_about_video_games/ "It seems that most of the **peer** reviewed articles on violence in video games indicate that it causes **aggressive** behavior in children and young adults yet most of reddit rejects this conclusion. What do the psychologists of reddit think of the conclusion? Is it wrong?"

## 2013-02-17 Media Ecology Psycology "video games indicate that it causes aggressive behavior"

It seems that most of the peer reviewed articles on violence in video games indicate that it causes aggressive behavior in children and young adults yet most of reddit rejects this conclusion. What do the psychologists of reddit think of the conclusion? Is it wrong?

## Sumer of 1986 Skywalker Ranch Science Fiction H.Q. 

The Empire of Skywalker has Fallen since 1998.

* Summer of 1986?: "The mother is really a **more immediate parent** than the father because one is born from the mother, and the first experience of any infant is the mother."

* Summer of 1985?: "Now, today there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity. But then **what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to have to face — because aggression is a natural instinct** just as much as, and **more immediate than**, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact."

Echos of [echoland! caution!](https://youtu.be/WoiJVkdDbOo?t=288) and echos of Carol's agression / Mr. White Walter White Gravesite agression at Episode One minute Twenty-Two.

(This same Skywalker book teaches the meaning of the word "Pluribus" and he vs. she in Latin, the Founding Fathers *hive mind*. Not just *any* book I am citing here. Pirate Lady metaphors abound in that Latin encoding deconstruction of Founding Fathers metaphors in summer 1985 / summer 1986 / 1987 leading to book (Helen) post-death publication 1988.)

#### callback: Writers Guild ARG / Writers Guilt

* Summer of 1985? "what is unfortunate for us is that a lot of the **people who write these stories** do not have the sense of their responsibility. These stories are making and breaking lives. But the movies are made simply to make money. The kind of responsibility that goes into a priesthood with a ritual is not there. That is ***one*** of **our problems today**."

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE at the top of media achievement and respect. Again year 2013. October 17, 2013 https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/17/anthony-hopkins-bryan-cranston-breaking-bad-fan-letter

### Vince Gilligan Echos February 28, 1954

"The other thing is that we have adopted a sort of a pragmatic test for right and wrong — whatever works is right. If it works, it's all right. Nothing is wrong but that which does not work. If you don't get caught, it's right. ... That's the attitude, isn't it? It's all right to disobey the Ten Commandments, but just don't disobey the eleventh, "Thou shall not get caught." ... That's the attitude. That's the prevailing attitude in our culture. No matter what you do, just do it with a bit of finesse. You know, a sort of attitude of the survival of the slickest. Not the Darwinian survival of the fittest, but the survival of the slickest — whoever can be the slickest is the one who right. It's all right to lie, but lie with dignity. ... It's all right to steal and to rob and extort, but do it with a bit of finesse. It's even all right to hate, but just dress your hate up in the garments of love and make it appear that you are loving when you are actually hating. Just get by! That's the thing that's right according to this new ethic. My friends, that attitude is destroying the soul of our culture! It's destroying our nation! The thing that we need in the world today is a group of men and women who will stand up for right and to be opposed to wrong, wherever it is."

Mr. White, Walter White, Teacher and Leader of video [gaming](https://old.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/181smu/is_the_reddit_hive_mind_wrong_about_video_games/) classroom of children. Tne non Ms. Rachel. The leader of men, Mr. White.

### Vince Gilligan Echos Duke University 1993 Texan 

A man raised in Texas, not so far from New Mexico, teaches at Duke University in 1993.

Mr. White, Walter White, Teacher like Rick Rodierick. Leader of young adults like Jesse Pink-man. Jesse has a middle class parenting and family with Mr. White teachers schol district real-esate school zone that gives him housing, but Jesse needs cash for the bling-bling life. Jesse is a video gamer. Is Mr. White teaching morality in schools, or is television and social media?

https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

Vince Gilligan Echos Texan Rick Roderick year 1993 when Mr. White was a student: "Well we are in a period now where I have already mentioned… And these are the phenomenon that Baudrillard examines with the most care. Incredible information overloads with information moving at incredible speed and even to the youngest children. I have talked about how children used to learn morality from their parents and now I think that [morality is learned from] Super Mario Brothers. They spend much more time with Super Mario Brothers and are much **more emotionally involved** with Nintendo than they are with their aunts, their uncles, their mothers and their fathers. I asked one of my children “Why are you yelling at a machine?” when he began to bang his Nintendo, and he looked at me as though I were a being from another world. And because of that there is a postmodern trajectory. I am from another world. I am still, as it were, caught in the modern. He’s not. Why not be emotional with a machine? His **peers are machine-like**, we have already discussed that. I mean in fact what he sees on the Nintendo screen is his thrill of the day. That’s the most active he’s seen any simulated image that day."

 His **peers are machine-like** .... his REDDIT peers. Again, year 2013 Reddit: https://old.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/181smu/is_the_reddit_hive_mind_wrong_about_video_games/ "It seems that most of the peer reviewed articles on violence in video games indicate that it causes aggressive behavior in children and young adults yet most of reddit rejects this conclusion. What do the psychologists of reddit think of the conclusion? Is it wrong?"

The amount of *wealth* that video games produce, Jesse's gaming expenses, can not be downplayed. The wealth of Apple //+ Apple App Store in selling music for gamers, selling games for iPad and iPhone can not be downplayed here! Jesse is a gamer, Mr. White his educator. Mr. White is no Rick Roderick when it comes to moral teaching to Jesse, is he?

### Video Game: War of All (Pluribus) against All (Pluribus)

I've emphasized year 2013, have I not? Anthony Hopkins year 2013. Reddit Psycology posting year 2913?  https://old.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/181smu/is_the_reddit_hive_mind_wrong_about_video_games/ "It seems that most of the peer reviewed articles on violence in video games indicate that it causes aggressive behavior in children and young adults yet most of reddit rejects this conclusion. What do the psychologists of reddit think of the conclusion? Is it wrong?"

Because something changed February 2014. A year afer 13. The Pluribus 13. The Great Seal Founding Fathers 13.

Something changed in year 2013. And it was described December 5, 2014 to the public. A report was compiled, a book was written, and like Carol and Helen, the book was published And a book tour, the OPENING DAY of the book tour December 5, 2014

Is a "vide game" not a "war of all against all"?

Vince Gilligant is a TV producer and writer, and December 5, 2014 I am pointing you all, We The People All, Pluribus All - to a television producer from across the world:

* "would go on to call the Fifth World War. The first nonlinear war of all against all. Which is a description by Vladislav Surkov, who sort of the ennui ??? of Russian politics, of the current (year 2014) war around Ukraine. um, so, I started working in Russian TV" https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxGLMkhbMgSwzWeQK7xYIBJ-nxn_UlzOdZ

A Pluribus Book Tour, A Grand Tour of a world-wide Television Reality TV producer from London / Moscow speaking in USA at the opening (not close of) Book Tour December 5, 2014
