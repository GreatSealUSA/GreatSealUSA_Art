"Carol represents the law and order of the new world. Even though we tease that she's super chaotic and irrational, the reality is she is the last visage of old world rules. The presidential seal behind her on the plane, driving the police car, even remarking how weird it was her mayor was cleaning her yard all are meant to symbolize how she's an institutionalist."

* Absent "idealist"

"They all arrived on different “planes”. Koumba realized he can simply choose the best plane he could imagine. C’est la vie. Carol chose coach, even after Zosia reminded her that First Class is more comfortable. She prefers misery because it’s familiar."

* empty coach on a new modern jet with best pilots in the world is "miserable". Window seat to see nature of Earth is "miserable"

* Carol just lost her spouse and shock if behavior never seen before. Grief not articulated in considering Carol's reaction.

"I think the hidden meaning is Koumba likes to cosplay as things like the President of the USA and as James Bond in the post assimilation world."

* indeed, James Bond style scene of card playing in later episode! Cards at the Westgate Hotel in Las Vegas, Episode 6, titled "HDP". Aired on December 5, 2025.
