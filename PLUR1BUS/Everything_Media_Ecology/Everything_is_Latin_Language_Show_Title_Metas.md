# Helen Tim Ladder Fall 

&nbsp;

Helen Post-Graduate *fell off* the Ladder of Jame's joyces progressive books.

She didn't SINGSONG the song! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdizZtOddC8 - sperm doner man at Public House outdoors smoke break.

ASSERTION: high-production effort of that video. Minute 22 is when Carol smokes, like a virgin, for the first time in adulthood. Emphasis on "lighting up" / Smoke Reak / Boozing Public House. The Joyce metaphros abound. Two women, Lady Liberty, with torches / touch screen phone lights up.

Man, seed of Carol's frozen eggs, in another time zone at the Zero Hour is the opening visuals of this music video to a public domain song. Who writes music videos for public domain songs? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdizZtOddC8

Commercial for-profit copyright authoring / publshing / book store at the airport crossing manipulation ... abounds.

Helen manpulating the drunk author's writings, Joyce the drunk author.

Gold mine of media ecology that "Hellen fell of the Tim Ladder Climb" of a singsong poetry. McLuhan University of Tronto post-doctorate study.  Steps of the Great Seal, low places, Helen hangs out with a low drunk and doesn't even bother to read her unpublished "Bitter Wake" work of 4.5 years, as a spouse! Disgrace, like Stephen D's wife sex metaphors and Dublin stories. On and on here. Ice cold bed.
