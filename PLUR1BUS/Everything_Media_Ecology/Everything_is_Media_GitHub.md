# Everything is Media GitHub

If only James Joyce had GitHub / git - for Finn's Hotel 1923 book onward ;)

If only the Founding Fathers had GitHub and we Neil Postman's media ecology was better understood.

Neil Postman, 1985 (BTTF), Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse

* "America was founded by intellectuals, from which it has taken us two centuries and a communications revolution to recover".

* "But the Founding Fathers did not foresee that tyranny by government might be superseded by another sort of problem altogether, namely, the corporate state, which through television now controls the flow of public discourse in America"

* “They had tangled several times before, and all of their encounters had been much lengthier and more exhausting. For example, on October 16, 1854, in Peoria, Illinois, Douglas delivered a three-hour address to which Lincoln, by agreement, was to respond. When Lincoln’s turn came, he reminded the audience that it was already 5 p.m., the he would probably require as much time as Douglas and that Douglas was still scheduled for a rebuttal. He proposed, therefore, that the audience go home, have dinner, and return refreshed for four more hours of talk. The audience amiably agreed, and matters proceeded as Lincoln had outlined.” https://www.minnpost.com/eric-black-ink/2016/09/little-perspective-debates-and-american-attention-span/

## Same year 1985 Summer

1985 summer, Joseph Campbell at California Skywalker Ranch for education of Star Wars audience:

* "They are Masonic signs, and the meaning of the **Pythagorean tetrakys** has been known for centuries. The **information would have been found in Thomas Jefferson's library**. These were, after all, learned men. The eighteenth-century Enlightenment was a world of learned gentlemen. We haven't had men of that quality in politics very much. It's an enormous good fortune for our nation that that cluster of gentlemen had the power and were in a position to influence events at that time." - age 81
