Episode Eight


"There’s an immense distance that has been travelled by human subjectivity – humans as subjects – [between Wuthering Heights](https://old.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/fhawqr/wuthering_heights_isnt_a_romance_but_instead_a/) and Love Story, and I hate to say it, there has been some distance travelled between Love Story and now, and movies like Heathers, Blade Runner, or just visiting Los Angeles. I mean, I don’t need to use examples, just visit Los Angeles. Just walk down the walk of stars at one o’clock in the morning, and ask yourself “Are these people really here, or is this central casting?” And *it isn’t a funny question*. And as our society develops in this telematic way, it’s *not going to be funny* to ask it around **the Christmas dinner table** about Uncle Henry, **“Is that Uncle Henry, or is it *just someone playing* Uncle Henry?"** The further postmodern insight is: what difference does it make! **See, that’s the thing Reagan’s handlers understood. It doesn’t make any difference! They’re buying it!** Well, that’s all I have to say for now…" - [Duke University](https://rickroderick.org/107-kierkegaard-and-the-contemporary-spirit-1990/)

Skywalker Ranch lessons for science fiction audiences, year 1988 published:

* "This story is of a Blackfoot tribe, long, long ago, who couldn’t get the buffalo to go over the cliff."

* "There is a kind of secondary hero to revitalize the tradition. This hero reinterprets the tradition and makes it valid as a living experience today instead of a lot of outdated clichés. This has to be done with all traditions."

* "The third function is the sociological one — supporting and validating a **certain social order**. And here’s where the myths **vary enormously from place to place**. You can have a whole mythology for polygamy, a whole mythology for monogamy. Either one’s okay. It depends on **where you are**. It is this sociological function of myth that has taken over **in our world** — and it is out of date. MOYERS: What do you mean? CAMPBELL: Ethical laws. The laws of life as it should be in **the good society**. All of **Yahweh’s pages and pages and pages of what kind of clothes to wear, how to behave to each other**, and so forth, in the first millennium B.C." - teaching in the shadow of the [Millennium Falcon](https://www.starwars.com/news/mythic-discovery-within-the-inner-reaches-of-outer-space-joseph-campbell-meets-george-lucas-part-i).

**Carol is in revolt**

New York, The Cooper Union     
Joseph Campbell     
Wednesday, March 1, 1967    
[Audio recording](https://open.spotify.com/track/4V5lOCrpJfNDcYDO6i3S2F) transcript    

To make myself clear, let me pause for a minute to say a few words about what seems to me to be the **Western idea of the individual**. I will take a few rather well known examples to illustrate the fact.
Carl Jung in his work speaks of the integration of the personality, and uses the word **“individuation”** rather frequently.  And to make clear what he means, he points out that each one of us is, by his society, **invited to play a certain role, a certain social role** in order to function. We play roles. These roles he calls personae, from the **Latin word** for the mask worn by an actor.

We all have to put on a mask of some sort in order to function in the society. And even those who choose not to function in the society — **to revolt from the society — put on masks too**. They wear certain insignia, you might say, that indicate, *I am in revolt*.

One can be impressed by a persona, by a mask. For example, if one meets a person and is talking to him and thinks one is beginning to establish some kind of rapport, and then learns, let us say, that this is the distinguished ambassador from such and such a place, the mask comes in front of that person and a certain awe in your relationship to him, and this person becomes what Jung calls a mana personality — a personality with magical powers — so that you are not talking directly to *him*.

In order to be individuated, in order to be an individual, we must distinguish between ourselves and the mask that we wear. Now this mask goes very deep; it includes moral ideas, it includes judgment systems. These archetypes for action have been **impressed upon us** by our society.

Now I take Jung’s idea of the individuation as a rather clean-cut example of an Occidental ideal: that one should put on the mask and take it off. **When you come home in the evening are you still Mr. President, or do you leave that in the office? If you keep your mask on, you know what we say of such a person: he is a stuffed shirt. The personality gradually disappears, and this is a particular disaster** if one becomes impressed by one’s own mask. Here we have a real mirage phenomenon: *nobody there*. 

Now let me say that the typical ideal in the Orient is that one should become identified with the mask. The whole pattern of education throughout the Orient is: *Believe what you’re told, do what you’re told, do not ask questions*. For an Occidental teaching Oriental students, **it is absolutely bewildering — the submissiveness** (March 1, 1967). For an Oriental teaching Occidental students, the challenges are **shocking**. There is no respect for the professor [qua](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/qua) professor.

# **Carol**, *The Individual* of 13 symbolic     

The traditional notion of a mature adult is a person who behaves as he ought to behave — who behaves as the society has always asked him to behave. Grandpa behaved this way; so did Great - grandpa. And **every kid who didn't was eaten**. So we all behaved this way; that is to say, the adult is the one who accepts and represents the order of the society **without question. This you get in all traditional** societies.

Now, you know what we call a person who behaves that way: this we call a stuffed shirt. He has never built anything particular out of himself. **He has simply done as told**. He's sure of what's right and what's wrong, and that's that. Now we can't have this anymore, and we don't want it. Our notion in our society today of an **adult mind** is a mind that accepts responsibility for its own actions, that judges in terms of values, not saying, “Oh, I want this because I like it,” but in terms of an ordered, considered value scale. The **individual is to judge**, the individual is to criticize, and **the individual is to represent — with courage and loyalty** — his judgments.

Now, this asks a lot of the society itself that wasn't asked before. This also tends to shatter the idea of authority. Now that idea was formally validated by—say it came from God; the Lord of the Universe ordered things this way for the society. A point I want to make is this: that all of these divine interpretations of local laws, of local social orders, are simply cooked up; they are not true. The society has changed with time. These are functions of conditions — of geography **and history. One must realize that the moral order is in flux, is changing. There is no** ***God***-**given right, wrong, true, false, moral, immoral**. And with that kind of *relativism*, one is free to live as a human being, not simply as a robot, repeating patterns that have been enforced from the past. So we have a much more sophisticated idea toward **the social order**.

However when it comes to this other problem of the natural order, one's nature as man, the thing is not quite so *relativistic*.

# Another time: 1990 vs 1993 

Roderick a few years later.

**Carol declines the invitation to play cards with cousin Henry**. Carol chooses to watch Golden Girls for her family gathering. Again, minute 8 of Episode Eight. Carol exclaims that playing with one member of the hive mind is just the same. Roderick covered that behavior of suburban family life too. (Assertion: We are in "Everything is Media Ecology", "Everything is ME" GitHub folder context, films and VHS vs. streaming Apple TV+). Reminder: Space-time is Christmas 2005 vs. Christmas 2025 Episode Nine.

1993

"Now simulation in this society didn’t just come from nowhere. This society of simulations and of spectacles. Baudrillard actually builds his work on a foundation again that comes out of the Marxist tradition. Guy Debord wrote a book in the sixties called “The Society of the Spectacle“. And what it was about, was about how when capitalism reached a certain level of accumulation, commodities began to detach themselves and become images. And citizens who formerly had **played roles** as political actors began to detach themselves from their own lives and become spectators."

"So for example you could say now, **instead of, like, going to a family reunion now we will just rent, you know, a Steve Martin Father of the Bride movie**. It’s just as good and so on, and you meet the same kooky characters that you actually know. Their behaviour is all simulatable. Another similar… and this going to sound cynical, but I don’t want it to."
