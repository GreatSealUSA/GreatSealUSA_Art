"There’s an immense distance that has been travelled by human subjectivity – humans as subjects – [between Wuthering Heights](https://old.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/fhawqr/wuthering_heights_isnt_a_romance_but_instead_a/) and Love Story, and I hate to say it, there has been some distance travelled between Love Story and now, and movies like Heathers, Blade Runner, or just visiting Los Angeles. I mean, I don’t need to use examples, just visit Los Angeles. Just walk down the walk of stars at one o’clock in the morning, and ask yourself “Are these people really here, or is this central casting?” And *it isn’t a funny question*. And as our society develops in this telematic way, it’s *not going to be funny* to ask it around **the Christmas dinner table** about Uncle Henry, **“Is that Uncle Henry, or is it *just someone playing* Uncle Henry?"** The further postmodern insight is: what difference does it make! **See, that’s the thing Reagan’s handlers understood. It doesn’t make any difference! They’re buying it!** Well, that’s all I have to say for now…" - [Duke University](https://rickroderick.org/107-kierkegaard-and-the-contemporary-spirit-1990/)

The time displacement of Rick Roderick's 1990 lecture: "an immense distance that has been travelled by human subjectivity"

* "This story is of a Blackfoot tribe, long, long ago, who couldn’t get the buffalo to go over the cliff."

* "There is a kind of secondary hero to revitalize the tradition. This hero reinterprets the tradition and makes it valid as a living experience today instead of a lot of outdated clichés. This has to be done with all traditions."

* "The third function is the sociological one — supporting and validating a **certain social order**. And here’s where the myths **vary enormously from place to place**. You can have a whole mythology for polygamy, a whole mythology for monogamy. Either one’s okay. It depends on **where you are**. It is this sociological function of myth that has taken over **in our world** — and it is out of date. MOYERS: What do you mean? CAMPBELL: Ethical laws. The laws of life as it should be in **the good society**. All of **Yahweh’s pages and pages and pages of what kind of clothes to wear, how to behave to each other**, and so forth, in the first millennium B.C."
