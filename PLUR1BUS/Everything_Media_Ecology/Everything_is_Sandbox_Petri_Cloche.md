# Everything is Sandbox Petri Cloche

This is written after Episode Eight, a couple days before Christmas / Episode Nine season climax.

* "cloche" is a *biodome* metaphor in this context. Plantary biosphere. The Northern Lights / police lights in the sky of Episode Three emphasize this perspective. We are in an enclosure with a window looking up at 78 second RNA messages from another world. Life exists on other worlds. We are the life petri dish / sandboxed experiment. 

* Food, sustenance is a constant theme. The opening of the cloche to reveal food. The sandboxed Lauchlin's diner acting / *West* Gate casino card game acting. A [Breaking Bad dirty business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsjdjWGDvFk) meetup location in ABQ storytelling legends.

&nbsp;

* This is a "petri dish" story, emphasizes throughout the show to the audience. Carol doesn't know of the petri dishes. Another way to describe a "petri dish" story is "sandboxed" story in video games. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_game "Albuquerque (ABQ) soil is typically sandy, alkaline, and low in organic matter".

People aren't yet getting the scope of Kepler life on other planets.

* REFERENCE: "Oats Studios - Volume 1 - God: Serengeti" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1_HfhtB5eo /\ "Oats Studios - God: City" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4AGocVq7-w - again, Carol does not have what we see from above (like in the Oats Studios, we see from above) the petri dish emphasis to *the audience* to look above / look beyond Kepler.

* Look To Christmas day power that Vince Gilligan can choose and pick with his extreme power and charm of streaming venues. His Breaking Bad and Saul street cred to turn an audience. Vince Gilligan's petri dish campaign is not for Carol to see, she is inside the sandbox of Oats Studio Volumes. We, The People, the audience are having our head turned to the petri dish perspective https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distracted_boyfriend - Vince Gilligan has that power to control the marketing / the show dates / the February 15, 2025 lecture about the **cesspool of social media**. You cultivate diseases of a cesspool in a petri dish.

* Assertion of context for my interpretations of Christmas stories and legends and cults of story telling / story authoring / book stores and book venue cults. "Creative Mythology is Volume IV of the comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell's The Masks of God. The book concerns "creative mythology", Campbell's term for the efforts by an individual to communicate his experience through signs, an attempt that can become "living myth"." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Mythology - I think Vince Gilligan is a living legend.

Warning: Long reply. Christmas season. It will be a long time until episode 10. Savor these hours as we count down to episode 9.

Carol doesn't seem to question out loud (or on her white board) why she is getting so much attention and labor by the hive mind. Such as the rebuilding of her Lauchlin's diner writing spot, and the sending of the Pirate Lady instead of just some local ABQ person she knows of like the mayor (as an ambassador to her).

There are a lot of things that only the audience knows. For one, the name of the show / title. We can connect this to the USA Latin slogan, but nobody within the show has such associations. Within the show, we have seen zero evidence Carol is even thinking about her frozen cells and a child, that is all presented to us in flashback as an audience. But Carol doesn't have that in her thinking as far as we can tell. She did not seem to notice the wording of the West Gate sign message about not taking cells from her boy in an invasive procedure.

Carol seems entirely oblivious that she has oocytes frozen away from years and years ago. She seems to have entirely forgotten about this. It is only the audience who has been "reminded" of this scientific possibility.

Carol does not seem to get the scope of just how concerned the hive mind is with her. She is not recognizing that their book fandom behavior and rebuilding the book ground as "holy ground" goes deeper.

Carol does not see anything that deep about Christmas year 2005 and Cousin Henry being played in the card game. To the audience, the show season ending on Christmas is a huge thing. Family members who don't know how to reconnect. 

The hive mind has shown no ritual religion decorations or symbolism other than building "holy lands" shrine of Carol's book writing Lauchlin's diner and hanging on her every new page of writing abut her stories.

Carol is told she can have an atomic bomb. She really seems to not recognize that the hive mind isn't just doing self-interest things. She has more power than any human person in all history!  They hang on her every word and movement. 

Was that the intention of the virus all along, to have people outside the virus who direct and lead it? She has the power to emotionally bring her followers to their knees, to crash the whole hive mind.

I think people aren't seeing the subtext here. Carol is a God to the hive mind, the hive mind is being directed by Carol like a *cult* following to her books and shrines to her authoring. She hasn't even realized how desperate her religious following is to "be one with God' on Christmas ending . The Episode Eight Christmas 2005 Henry line is telegraphing this to the audience. Vince Gilligan is the most popular television show creator in the entire world history of humanity. https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/17/anthony-hopkins-bryan-cranston-breaking-bad-fan-letter

Carol is *Bigger than Jesus*. Vince Gilligan could have scheduled his show to be aired any calendar choice he desired. He has that much popularity and influence. Any streaming network would take his show. He could have released all 9 episodes in one day like the first couple episodes. 

It is no accident that he gave a lecture at the guild on February 15, 2025 and that the season ends on Christmas. Carol does not see these things, she is just one person / one brain. But we the audience can rewind / rematch / create clips and see a bigger picture.

Carol does not know that her own name is taken from a Twilight Zone episode. Carol does not know Breaking Bad is where the Zero Hour [grave site of Walter White is in Episode One of Pluribus](https://old.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1osq6ci/pluribus_s01e01_has_an_obscure_tie_to_both_bb_and/). Carol does not know the on-screen countdown and countup timers. 

On Air Force One, Carol says we have all seen these "pod people" alien invasion stories and they don't end well. The elephant in the room is why wouldn't the aliens just murder / kill the 13 people. Lock them up in a guided prison cell where they can't escape. You don't hand them bombs and atomic devices on a platter when they ask.

No, this story is very different. Christmas day climax of season and building Lauchlin's as a holy shrine. Carol has not caught on, nor has the audience. Carol is a holy prophet / leading the hive mind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8s_q3IaglQ
