# Everything is Sandbox Petri Cloche

This is written after Episode Eight, a couple days before Christmas / Episode Nine season climax.

* "cloche" is a *biodome* metaphor in this context. Plantary biosphere. The Northern Lights / police lights in the sky of Episode Three emphasize this perspective. We are in an enclosure with a window looking up at 78 second RNA messages from another world. Life exists on other worlds. We are the life petri dish / sandboxed experiment.
