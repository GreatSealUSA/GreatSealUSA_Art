# Pluribus Wikipedia Ecology

I made an episode description edit, it took less than 4 minutes for an admin (powerful) on Wikipedia to revert it. 

In a show about decoding messages from outer space, code cracking of symbolism, no thinking outside the box. Many have noted this HDP assoction.

I am not going to fight it, a powerful Wikipedia Admin is clearly instantly being notified and guarding the page for Pluribus TV show. Masked I.C.E. like MAGA USA against Great Seal of the United States of America multi-lingual metaphors. 

OPERA_A can't associate metaphorical meanings of tin can alley visuals of eating right out of can, drinking right out of the bottle, to the HDP food-source title of the episode. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnLo01m8y04 "Thick as a Brick (Edit #1) (2001 Remaster)" - which kitchen sink is Carol's sperm in with the eggs in the freezer of the kitchen? 1997 Remaster, edited, post Y2K. Sandcastles Spanish virtues washed away like sperm spit into the sink basin. Your I.C.E. wise men, wisecracking anti-immigrant men... the LOVE is so far away! This is a "Bad dream" of Finnegans Wake anti-Woke year 1923, "Finn's Hotel", you shake your head... 840,204 views November 6, 2014

The character in the show literally eats dog food from a can. see: https://old.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1p7pcui/whats_up_with_the_dog_food/

HDP topic, the title of the Wikipedia / Pluribus Episode title... is about *food source*, so associating his dog food eating with dog metaphors is not a stretch at all.

"No original thinking" is the cited reason. Outside the hive mind of Wikipedia. " Original research (the key definition of HDP is defined in the show itself" only ONE definition is provided. Just because there is only one provided does not mean the context and symbolism of eating dog food can isn't there. This is a show about the year 1776 USA nation values being encoded by the Founding Fathers into Latin language of an ideal proposal for a goodness hive mind, "We The People" cherry-picking with the Great Seal of the Untied States of America from the entire Library of Alexandria, Library of Congress, Public Library of humanity! Not just one Levant book, the King James Bible in English language.

### Rick Roderick on Wikipedia power ! Knowledge

I experienced of a *Johnny on the spot* less than 4 minutes watching the page like an eagle with instant notification to remove immigrant Spanish langauge metaphors from the page.

Texan Rick Roderick, Duke University:

"Now when I have my students argue with me about this thesis that: **where you find knowledge or information there also you will find power**, if they keep arguing with me I threaten to given them a “C” and then they agree with me [crowd laughter]. And that is what I call a demonstration by direction, or a West Texas phrase for it would be “hitting a mule upside the head to get his attention”; that will get a student’s attention, when they realise that your power is connected to your knowledge and vice versa. By the way if they happened to be the son or daughter of a three or four million dollar donor to Duke then their power is connected to how their knowledge may have to be treated by someone, although I generally ignored that kind of thing, in fact I always ignored it."

"Alright now that’s the thesis that is considered – as hard as it may be to believe, because I think I presented it in a commonsensical way – this is the thesis that seems to have outraged a whole group of people at universities as though this doesn’t speak to the experience of – and of course it does, this is why they associate it with political correctness, because this always spoke to the experience of those who have just entered such systems; women when they first came to the university, African Americans, **Chicanos and so on have always experienced**"
