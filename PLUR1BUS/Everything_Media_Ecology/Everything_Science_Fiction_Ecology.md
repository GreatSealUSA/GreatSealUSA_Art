# Everything Science Fiction Ecology

The entire minds of the world working together have ten years to solve the food supply issue.

E=MC2 messages abound.

The ultimate non-killing no-kill no-harm science fiction storytelling is The Pilot episode of Star Trek https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cage_(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series)

Food replicators. The evolution of human life / humanity developing E=MC2 to turn energy into matter, foodstuff, food matters. Carol is already brainstroming the New Mexico [Man-hattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project), Carol is already meltdown { powering / pondering } the E=MC2 applications of New Mexico technology. Can the Hive Mind [be reversed](https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/), can the E=MC2 equation be reversed, can Energy originate (first side of the equation) foodstuff without organic origins? Without original sin of plucking the Apple //+? Or will Carol call to fight with [*the bomb* against](https://youtu.be/8tIdCsMufIY?t=163) the world-wide-web of hive minds?

* [Skywalker Gauchos Metaphors Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell_and_the_Power_of_Myth), { 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988 }: "while from the buried parts of the dismembered body **food plants** grew. Time had come into being, death, birth, and the killing and eating of other living beings, for the preservation of life. The timeless time of the beginning had been **terminated by a communal crime**, a **deliberate murder** or sacrifice. Now, one of the [main problems of mythology](https://youtu.be/kFrffEktluo?t=3318) is reconciling the mind to this brutal precondition of all life, which lives by the killing and **eating of lives**. You don’t kid yourself by eating *only vegetables*, either, for they, too, are alive. So the essence of life is this eating of itself! Life lives on lives, and the **reconciliation of the human mind**"
