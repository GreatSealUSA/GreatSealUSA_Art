# Everything Science Fiction Ecology

The entire minds of the world working together have ten years to solve the food supply issue.

E=MC2 messages abound.

The ultimate non-killing no-kill no-harm science fiction storytelling is The Pilot episode of Star Trek https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cage_(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series)

Food replicators. The evolution of human life / humanity developing E=MC2 to turn energy into matter, foodstuff, food matters. Carol is already brainstroming the New Mexico [Man-hattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project), Carol is already meltdown { powering / pondering } the E=MC2 applications of New Mexico technology. Can the Hive Mind [be reversed](https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/), can the E=MC2 equation be reversed, can Energy originate (first side of the equation) foodstuff without organic origins? Without original sin of plucking the Apple //+? Or will Carol call to fight with [*the bomb* against](https://youtu.be/8tIdCsMufIY?t=163) the world-wide-web of hive minds?

* [Skywalker Gauchos Metaphors Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell_and_the_Power_of_Myth), { 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988 }: "while from the buried parts of the dismembered body **food plants** grew. Time had come into being, death, birth, and the killing and eating of other living beings, for the preservation of life. The timeless time of the beginning had been **terminated by a communal crime**, a **deliberate murder** or sacrifice. Now, one of the [main problems of mythology](https://youtu.be/kFrffEktluo?t=3318) is reconciling the mind to this brutal precondition of all life, which lives by the killing and eating of lives. You don’t kid yourself by eating only vegetables, either, for they, too, are alive. So the essence of life is this eating of itself! Life lives on lives, and the **reconciliation of the human mind**"
