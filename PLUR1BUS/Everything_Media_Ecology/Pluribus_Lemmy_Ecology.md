> The mental illness is on Truth Social and Fox News HDTV.

There are many different types of mental illness and you’re insulting millions of people, including many on Lemmy, right now by implying that their condition means that they are MAGAs. Good job. Very sensitive.

In your case though, my guess is stimulant abuse. I’ve seen this type of posting before. Amphetamines cause a unique blend of dunning kruegar and inane rambling that’s easy to spot if you know where to look.

## Analyzing that message

So they start talking about their drug addiction, stimulant drugs, and think Pluribus isn't a story about book fandom, book touring, book authors, book selling, book promoting, book reading, book writing, authoring, etc. They think ChatGPT is what Pluribus is about. So that seems to be their motivation for the two-paragraph reply to me, saying I'm a drug stimulant abuser for calling out Fox News HDTV audience.

There seems to be a Vince Gilligan / Braking Bad fandom issue with drug pushers, drug dealers, drug sellers, drug fascination. They like the ABQ story about drug selling, Walter White?

> Seen it in the mirror. you a druggie, a drug abuser? A junkie who knows the *good shit*? You do a lot of energy drinks for stimulation on 4-day holiday New Years 2026 weekend?

That is the least coherent “I’m rubber and you’re glue” I’ve ever seen

> How come your electronic Lemmy reply message in no way discusses the YouTube video linked?

Because I didn’t watch it. You posted it, there’s a 0% chance it’s worth my time.

> You think a founding father of the United States of America is rambling?

Are you claiming to be a founding father now?

&nbsp;

My reply message:

> Are you claiming to be a founding father now?

No, I'm not claiming that.

You seem to have literacy issues. You can't understand the Founding Fathers language, too old for your Lemmy mindset.

Your drug-messaging speaks for itself. Your fixation on meth and other drug use. Instead of focusing  on your English literacy and **context blindness issues in your own brain**.

* You start pushing and pondering *drugs* when you read a posting on Lemmy high speed messaging system titled **"Smiling Hive Mind Season One: "E pluribus unum" ++ "Annuit cœptis" … meaning "many signal interpositions" 8.613 MHz / 4-level FSK at 400 baud"**

&nbsp;

Because you can't understand symbolism of the Free Masons Founding Fathers of the United States of America year 1776 ideals.  You are so **meme addled with Lemmy trash content** that you think "drugs" because it blows your mind to actually read a book on printed paper.

>  I didn’t watch it.

It shows. You are anti-literacy, anti-learning, anti-understanding, anti-comprehension. You come along and say *har har, drugs, I'm a druggie* messages. [Your **context blindness**](https://www.amazon.com/Context-Blindness-Technology-Evolution-Understanding/dp/1433186136) behavior / mindset on Lemmy - that the posting is a quote from a Founding Father of the United States of America, which you clearly minded drug users more than educators.

My reply message, a teachable moment: 

> I did not read a word of that, Jessie Pinkman.

Exactly. You are an agent of banality. Here to banalize the Founding Father(s) of the United States of America symbolism; education, and teachings. Your hero you worship, "Jessie Pinkman", the high school drugie video gamer who avoids nonfiction books, your meme super-man!

Every message from you is to attack Founding Father USA teaching on Lemmy. A jamming signal, to promote your drug memes and addictions to trash content.

3-word shit-commenting.

"Russia-watcher Catherine Fitzpatrick, who documents Kremlin disinformation for InterpreterMag . com, says just as Moscow uses vague Internet laws to encourage self-censorship, trolls inhibit informed debate by using crude dialogue to change "the climate of discussion." "If you show up at The Washington Post or New Republic sites, where there's an article that's critical of Russia, and you see that there are 200 comments that sound like they were written by 12-year-olds, then you just don't bother to comment," she says.  "You don't participate. It's a way of just driving discussion away completely," she adds. "Those kinds of tactics are meant to stop democratic debate, and they work." - **year 2014** https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/the-kremlins-troll-army/375932/

# Fox News, not *drug* use or ChatGPT 

&nbsp;

This person who replied to me just can't seem to have a level-headed discussion about the problems of Fox News HDTV audience. They start talking about stimulant drugs. Also, have they never heard of Starbucks, coffee, caffeine, energy drinks? This is a New Years 4-day Holiday weekend in USA. Are they high on Starbucks and psychologically projecting? Quoting the Lemmy user: "stimulant abuse. I’ve seen this type of posting before. Amphetamines"...

&nbsp;

My posting was about the Great Seal of the USA and Fox News HDTV. Here are a couple nonfiction books for context on Fox News and hive-mind information filter-bubbles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble

&nbsp;

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”
― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13.

“If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.”
― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: [Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019, Page ???](https://books.google.com/books?id=Mt5sDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT95&dq=%E2%80%9CIf+all+information+is+seen+as+part+of+a+war,+out+go+any+dreams%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)
