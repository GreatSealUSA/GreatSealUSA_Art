There are many different types of mental illness and you’re insulting millions of people, including many on Lemmy, right now by implying that their condition means that they are MAGAs. Good job. Very sensitive.

In your case though, my guess is stimulant abuse. I’ve seen this type of posting before. Amphetamines cause a unique blend of dunning kruegar and inane rambling that’s easy to spot if you know where to look.
