> The mental illness is on Truth Social and Fox News HDTV.

There are many different types of mental illness and you’re insulting millions of people, including many on Lemmy, right now by implying that their condition means that they are MAGAs. Good job. Very sensitive.

In your case though, my guess is stimulant abuse. I’ve seen this type of posting before. Amphetamines cause a unique blend of dunning kruegar and inane rambling that’s easy to spot if you know where to look.

## Analyzing that message

So they start talking about their drug addiction, stimulant drugs, and think Pluribus isn't a story about book fandom, book touring, book authors, book selling, book promoting, book reading, book writing, authoring, etc. They think ChatGPT is what Pluribus is about. So that seems to be their motivation for the two-paragraph reply to me, saying I'm a drug stimulant abuser for calling out Fox News HDTV audience.

There seems to be a Vince Gilligan / Braking Bad fandom issue with drug pushers, drug dealers, drug sellers, drug fascination. They like the ABQ story about drug selling, Walter White?

# Fox News, not *drug* use or ChatGPT 

&nbsp;

This person who replied to me just can't seem to have a level-headed discussion about the problems of Fox News HDTV audience. They start talking about stimulant drugs. Also, have they never heard of Starbucks, coffee, caffeine, energy drinks? This is a New Years 4-day Holiday weekend in USA. Are they high on Starbucks and psychologically projecting? Quoting the Lemmy user: "stimulant abuse. I’ve seen this type of posting before. Amphetamines"...

My posting was about the Great Seal of the USA and Fox News HDTV. Here are a couple nonfiction books for context on Fox News and hive-mind information filter-bubbles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

“If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.”
