#Pluribus seriously sucks. Was so excited that #VinceGilligan created a new show and I had high hopes, but this show is really dumb. It’s pretentious, the main character is really annoying, and there is no dark humor in it like it claims. So disappointing. 😩"

"PS—huge sci-fi fan here, too. But this just isn’t good. Pretty sure the high ratings are from Gilligan fans who’ve convinced themselves that anything he creates is amazing."
