# Carol "the boozer" Twelve Steps

Roger Ebert comes to mind, who was rather open about his twelve step program to his audience.

Carol is a writer / author like Roger Ebert. But does she tell her audience about her boozing problem? Was there an incident in her past, an accident of some kind that law enforcement / goverment stepped in (step pun intended). Did the incident make the press, since she is a famous author / entertainer?

Twelve Step Programs

how many steps on the Great Seal of the United States of America... 12 and bonus leap to 13.

Aside... previous shows from writers center around meth drug abuse. Booze tends to be considered "classy" drug to abuse in high society / executive functions.
