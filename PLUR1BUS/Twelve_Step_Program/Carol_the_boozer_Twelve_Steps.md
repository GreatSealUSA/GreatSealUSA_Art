# Caro "the boozer" Twelve Steps

Roger Ebert comes to mind, who was rather open about his twelve step program to his audience.

Carol is a writer / author like Roger Ebert. But does she tell her audience about her boozing problem? Was there an incident in her past, an accident of some kind that law enforcement / goverment stepped in (step pun intended).

Twelve Step Programs

how many steps on the Great Seal of the United States of America... 12 and bonus leap to 13.
