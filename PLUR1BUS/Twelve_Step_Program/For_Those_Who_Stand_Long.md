Yes, there are two paths, Carol, there is still time to change the airplane you are on! And it makes me wonder / wander....

Your head is humming, and it won't go in case you don't know. Dear lady?

Your Air Force One Stairway lies on the whispering wind....

1988, The Power Of Myth 

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: That’s not always easy to find. But it’s nice to have someone who can give you a clue. That’s the teacher’s job, to help you find your Ariande thread.

BILL MOYERS: Like all heroes, the Buddha doesn’t show you the truth itself, he shows you the way to truth.

CAMPBELL: But it’s got to be your way, not his. The Buddha can’t tell you exactly how to get rid of your particular fears, for example. Different teachers may suggest exercises, but they may not be the ones to work for you. All a teacher can do is suggest. He is like a lighthouse that says, “There are rocks over here, steer clear. There is a channel, however, out there.”

The big problem of any young person’s life is to have models to suggest possibilities. Nietzsche says, **“Man is the sick animal.”** Man is the animal that doesn’t know what to do with itself. The mind has many possibilities, but we can live no more than one life. What are we going to do with ourselves? A living myth presents contemporary models.

MOYERS: Today, we have an endless variety of models. A lot of people end up choosing many and never knowing who they are.

CAMPBELL: When you choose your vocation, you have actually chosen a model, and it will fit you in a little while. **After middle life, for example, you can pretty well tell what a person’s profession is**. Wherever I go, people know I’m a professor. I don’t know what it is that I do, or how I look, but I, too, can tell professors from engineers and merchants. You’re shaped by your life.
