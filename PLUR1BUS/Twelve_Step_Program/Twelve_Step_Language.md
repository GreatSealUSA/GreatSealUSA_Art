"The Power of Myth", filmed by George Lucas at Skywalker Ranch, published year 1988:

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Yes. You see, this is a problem you get in the book of Kings and in Samuel. The various Hebrew kings were sacrificing on the mountaintops. And they did wrong in the sight of Yahweh. The Yahweh cult was a specific movement in the Hebrew community, which finally won. This was a pushing through of a certain temple-bound god against the nature cult, which was celebrated all over the place.

And this **imperialistic thrust of a certain in-group culture is continued in the West**. But it has got to open to the nature of things now. If it can open, all the possibilities are there.

BILL MOYERS: Of course, we moderns are **stripping the world of its natural revelations, of nature itself**. I think of that pygmy legend of the little boy who finds the **bird with the beautiful song** in the forest and brings it home.

CAMPBELL: He asks his father to bring food for the bird, and the father doesn’t want to **feed a mere bird, so he kills it**. And the legend says the man killed the bird, and with the bird he killed the song, and with the song, himself. He dropped dead, completely dead, and was dead forever.

MOYERS: Isn’t that a story about what happens when human beings destroy their environment? Destroy their world? Destroy nature and the revelations of nature?

CAMPBELL: They destroy their own nature, too. **They kill the song**.

MOYERS: And isn’t mythology the story of the song?

CAMPBELL: Mythology is the song. It is the song of the imagination, inspired by the energies of the body. Once a Zen master stood up before his students and was about to deliver a sermon. And just as he was about to open his mouth, a bird sang. And he said, “The sermon has been delivered.”
