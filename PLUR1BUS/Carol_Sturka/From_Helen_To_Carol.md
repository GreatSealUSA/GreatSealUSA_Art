# From Helen To Carol

1. can the hive mind read minds of Carol? no. but PART of the hive mind knows the predictable parts of humanity. The subconsious, automatic, the reactionary.

2. The sun in your eyes make some of the eyes worth believing, Carol
  
3. I am a reaper drone looking at you, fool
  
4. I know now the true story of your drinking an the law, the meter on your starter of your car, and your airpoort bamboozle about not having a drink.
