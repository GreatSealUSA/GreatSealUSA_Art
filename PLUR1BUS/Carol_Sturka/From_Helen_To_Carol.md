# From Helen To Carol

1. can the hive mind read minds of Carol? no. but PART of the hive mind knows the predictable parts of humanity. The subconsious, automatic, the reactionary.

2. The sun in your eyes make some of the eyes worth believing, Carol
  
3. I am a reaper drone looking at you, fool
  
4. I know now the true story of your drinking an the law, the meter on your starter of your car, and your airpoort bamboozle about not having a drink.

Spouse, marriage.

She can cheat Carol blind, you should have already published your Wake "Work In Progress" manuscript.... Carol.

1988 "The Power Of Myth"

BILL MOYERS: So marriage is utterly incompatible with the idea of doing one’s own thing.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It’s not simply one’s own thing, you see. It is, in a sense, doing one’s own thing, but the one isn’t just you, it’s the two together as one. And that’s a purely mythological image signifying the sacrifice of the visible entity for a **transcendent good**. This is something that becomes beautifully realized in the **second stage of marriage**, what I call the alchemical stage, of the two experiencing that they are one. If they are still living as they were in the primary stage of marriage, they will go apart when their children leave. Daddy will fall in love with some little nubile girl and run off, and Mother **will be left with an empty house and heart, and will have to work it out on her own, in her own way.**
