# Wife Helen

if (link) Finnegans Wake book publishing media ecology and "Work In Progress" themes of the 5 years unpublished work abound...

I find it curious the information asserted on the day of release:

"Carol is at a bar when the rest of the population, including **her wife** Helen, begins to twitch unconsciously."

Now that is a out-of-band but not alternate reality game, but REAL WORLD media ecology emphasis on it being a marriage.

&nbsp;

"I figure... you make even *one person* happy, that's not art*... and is that the deathbed wish of Helen as she enters the hive mind matrix? To amke Carol happy. Does Helen provide that programming to the hive mind.

Is the hive mind intelligent, or is it just driven like humanity is driven, like the future of humanity is driven. A mix of instinct, genetic lessons learned, experience / teaching / book writing / book reading.

Hellen is a unhappy person because she can't make Carol happy enough to give up the self-harm drinking behavior and self-loathing writing behavior.

Helen's one goal in life is to make Carol happy. And that impresses upon the hive mind.
