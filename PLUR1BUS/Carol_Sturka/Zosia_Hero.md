# Zosia Hero

Stephen Hero

"Zosia is a Polish feminine name meaning "wisdom," which is a diminutive form of the Polish name Zofia, a variant of the Greek name Sophia. The name is derived from the Greek word sophia, which signifies wisdom, knowledge, and good judgment."

The lost burned opening of a story that iterates, a monomyth iteration story. The lost inheritance of parent generations of humantiy.

Ending credits song, John Lennon. "Everybody's talking and no one says a word, Everybody's making love and no one really cares. There's Nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs."

## Fin Wake Parallels 

Real world context.

Part about Finnegans Wake is the most memorable

Now... this has extremely deep meaning. Does Carol get happy with the Fall knolwedge of killing people when she induces pod people kernel panic? 

This has a REAL counterpat in the Dublin story context .... Martin Luther triggered a pod people panic in Germany. 

* "It's impossible to give an exact number of deaths directly attributable to Martin Luther, as his reformation sparked a series of religious and political conflicts that spanned a century and resulted in millions of deaths. The most significant conflict, the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), alone killed an estimated eight million people, while the French Wars of Religion claimed three million lives. The Reformation created a violent period of warfare where families were often pitted against each other." - Google search A.I. 2025-11-07

## Makes One Person Happy?

If that One Person is The Pope, of that One Person is a Tyrant King... is that good? Not really. Making a single person happy with garbage media... is a drag on all humanity with her "Amusing Ourselves To Death" content. Is the whole "if it makes Donald Trump, one fiction media consumer, happy..."

Not to say tht Carol's readership depicted on the in-story social media and in-bookstore audience are dominating leaders. But my point is greater than that: Carol is not using her talents to soften Finnegans Wake's story, but Vince Gilligan is?! Self-aware or otherwise, Joyces MonoMyth *"Ah ho! Say no more about it! I'm sorry! I saw. I'm sorry! I'm sorry to say I saw!"* abounds (MonoMyth first appears in Finnegans Wake).

Is Vince G self-aware how deep he dug by that Finnegans Wake media ecology nane-drop? An artist trying to release their own secret "real story" that they could finish? All in Dublin, all one city...

The Wake is more Real than Real, more real than Hyperreal, more Real than John 1:1
