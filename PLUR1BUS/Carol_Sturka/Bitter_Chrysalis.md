August 16, 2019. "I thoroughly approve of both stories. They’re fun, original, and have just enough WTF-ery to keep things interesting from beginning to end. Bitter Chrysalis is ceaselessly amusing while repentant Chrysalis is… well, she certainly brings out some new ideas. I’m not sure why this is rated as Mature, though; the material is Teen at best."

"a quiescent insect pupa, especially of a butterfly or moth."   
"the transformation from egg to caterpillar to chrysalis and, finally, adult"    

Sounds like Portrait / Stephen Hero?

# Helen Published some of the Book

From what I gather, only two people in the world had read the "Work In Progress" (Fin Wake), but now that Helen joined the hive mind and had read the book - the book is now published world wide in the hive mind knowledge / treek of knowledge. (As of Episode Four, we learn that Helen read less than 200 pages of the book, including the ending on final 2 pages.)

That could be key.. the contents of that previously unpupblished book. In "Three Body Problem" that was the wall facers, they could not read minds. And "we can not read minds" (Carol's mind) has been emphasized several times (invoking science fiction "Three Body Problem" concept).

The polishing ideas that Carol has in her mind that are only in one place. 

The RNA was built without that secret sauce.

# Finnegans Wake metaphors

Finnegans Wake as a book is a bitter acid, a bitter LSD.

"Insects that go through a pupal stage are holometabolous: they go through four distinct stages in their life cycle"

Finnegans Wake is about four stages of humanity / Earth, iterations of 4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenian_Cycle

# Coming Out of the Closet

One possible read is that Helen was telling Carol to level up. She dropped Finnegans Wake on the table and encouraged Carol to stop being ashamed of her trashy romance pirate story and take serious the 4.5 years she had put into her unpublished work ("Work In Progress" was the original 1924 name for Finnegans Wake)

Standing outside the *public house* before her *fall*, Helen was asking Carol if she was ready to climb higher (come out of her pupa) and make a public statement that a woman was the original inspiration for the character.

Does Carol's fandom know she is married to a  woman, she is a lesbian?

The title of Carol's unpublished book could be interpreted as "my bitter coming out" (of the closet), as in sexual confrontation with USA society.

( Is the sex crime of our author in Phoenix Park (HCE) more than the car booze device? Is it changing her character, selling out her truth toa void confronting USA society, and now society is "Hello Carol!" confronting her? )
