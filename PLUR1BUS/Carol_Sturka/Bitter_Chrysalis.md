August 16, 2019. "I thoroughly approve of both stories. They’re fun, original, and have just enough WTF-ery to keep things interesting from beginning to end. Bitter Chrysalis is ceaselessly amusing while repentant Chrysalis is… well, she certainly brings out some new ideas. I’m not sure why this is rated as Mature, though; the material is Teen at best."

"a quiescent insect pupa, especially of a butterfly or moth."   
"the transformation from egg to caterpillar to chrysalis and, finally, adult"

# Helen Published the Book

From what I gather, only two people in the world had read the "Work In Progress" (Fin Wake), but now that Helen joined the hive mind and had read the book - the book is now published world wide in the hive mind knowledge / treek of knowledge. 

That could be key.. the contents of that previously unpupblished book. In "Three Body Problem" that was the wall facers, they could not read minds. And "we can not read minds" (Carol's mind) has been emphasized several times (invoking science fiction "Three Body Problem" concept).

The polishing ideas that Carol has in her mind that are only in one place. 

The RNA was built without that secret sauce.
