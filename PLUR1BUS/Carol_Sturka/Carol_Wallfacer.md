# Carol Wallfacer

Carol is a "Wallfacer" to the hive mind (a role from the science fiction book series 3 Body Problem)

For the Air Force One meeting, she clears the room and has all recording devices shut off, and she even blocks the outdoor windows.

Carol's "work in progress" (Fin Wake) book is now published by Helen. As Helen had read ***Bitter Chrysalis*** and uploaded it into the hive mind. However, Carol has in her mind edits and polish changes (such as perhaps inverting gender of some characters) that Helen did not know.

I also saw Carol calls them "pod people" on Air Force One, shortly after discussion about the Harrison Ford film having an "escape pod". And these metaphors all ring around Carol's book title,, "insect pupa"
