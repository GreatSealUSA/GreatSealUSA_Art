Carl Sagan on alien encounters:   

* Carol writer, literary author. “A literal reading of the Bible simply is a mistake; I mean it’s just wrong” - Carl Sagan

* Large VLA in New Mexico where the 78 second RNA message radio shack signal detection... “It’s an ancient human theme. You can find it in virtually every culture in some guise or other, in religion, folklore, superstition, and now in science. The search for life elsewhere is remarkable in our age because this is the first time that we can actually do something besides speculation. We can send spacecraft to nearby planets, **we can use large radio telescopes** to see if there is any message being sent to us lately. … It touches to the deepest of human concerns. Are we alone? How common is this thing called life, this thing called intelligence? Where did we come from? What are the possible fates of intelligent beings? **Need we necessarily destroy ourselves?** Might there be a bright and very long future for the human species? We tend to have such a narrow view of our place in space and in time, and the prospect of making contact with extraterrestrial intelligence works to de-provincialize our world view. I think for that reason, the search itself, even without a success, has great merit.” - Carl Sagan

Carol is extremely skeptical about space aliens messages of the hive mind. Science fiction vs. nonfiction science. Carol has the boozer literacy fandom experience like James Joyce. Carol was abused at age 16 in a Christian Bible anti-lesbian internment camp. First hand experience of wilding science fiction fandoms of the Levant science fiction trilogy (Torah, Bible, Quran).

NOVA: If you could speak directly to the multitudes of people who believe they're going to bed and perhaps being abducted by aliens, what is it you would like to say to them?

CARL SAGAN: If I were speaking to a group of abductees, I think the first thing I would do would be to tell them that I'm sure to many of them **the pain that is expressed is genuine, that they're not just making this up**. And it's very important to be compassionate. At the same time, I would stress that **hallucinations are a human common place, and not a sign that you are crazy. And that absolutely clear hallucinations have occurred to normal people** and it has a compelling feeling of reality, but it's generated in the head.

And that being the case, I would ask them to try to be as objective as they can and see if anything like that might, in fact, explain what they said happened to them. And I'd remind them that children, universally, have terrible nightmares, especially around 7 to 11, and wake up from sleep absolutely terrified about a monster, a witch, a goblin, a demon, and why shouldn't some of us retain that? I mean, there's no question that those monsters don't exist and **they're hiding in the closet** or under the bed. That's something generated in the mind. Why should it all go away when we grow up? We should retain some of that. And could not something like that be an explanation?
