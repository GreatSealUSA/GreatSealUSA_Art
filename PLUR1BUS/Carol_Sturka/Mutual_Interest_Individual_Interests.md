# Mutual Interest Individual Interests

"mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one"

"We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them." - Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth, year 1988, page 30
