# Carol as Eve Metaphors

She is an author of words, Bible verse John 1:1    

She is very critical and avoidant of "hive mind", "group think".

She has a book, work in progress, that is unpublished that she is concerned won't be accepted by society / proftiable to publish.

Her original book character had "Out of Africa" (Moroco) origins.

She does not read social media about her own work (her friend / partner checks it for her). She turns on television channels instead of going to the Internet to get public information. 

Is Eve standing up to the monomyth? Is Eve a independent woman who is climbing the Tree of Knowledge - not accepting outer-space messages as commandments?
