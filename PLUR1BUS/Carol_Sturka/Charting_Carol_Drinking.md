"Old Hoeland": This phrase is used in Book I, Chapter 7 (page 169.23-4 of the standard edition) as an allusion to "Old Hollands," which is a type of Dutch gin. "gulletburn gin": The text also contains phrases such as "served firstshot or gulletburn gin or honest brewbarrett beer either," which is a direct mention of the spirit (page 102.4).
