# Pluribus TV Show Reality

My interest in the show is media ecology literacy for the USA society and world. To address the outcomes of Cambridge Analytica and Russia's Internet Research Agency. To address Rupert Murdoch's Fox News, to address Elon Musk Twitter, etc. The popularity and embrace of negative paths for humanity.

### 4 seasons

They are talking about 4 seasons of the show, 2 already approved.

The show can go anywhere! How can we trust the world unchanged, reality itself, the way wars like Russia attacking Ukraine since February 2014 go on. Mental health workers can't seem to address Russia as a nation and convince humanity war is bad.

How can we trust the hive mind isn't being controlled by aliens from outer-space, and once some objective is met, they reprogram the hive mind with new directives?

* "It’s a great gift to **act on the emotions** rather than say them out loud,” Seehorn tells me. “Sometimes without even having to make the audience specifically sure of what I’m thinking.”

"The two fundamental human driver when it comes to taking information on board effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are unspoken and the even unconscious -- you didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you," Turnbull explained in a meeting with a reporter posing as "Ranjan," a prospective client from Sri Lanka.  

He continued, "And our job is to get, is to drop the **bucket further down the well than anybody else** to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. There is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's **all about emotion**."

The intro seemed AI in how it played to the audience. Toxic fans of Breaking Bad / Saul that the February 15, 2025 WGA preaching about social media behaviors.    

I have no idea if this is a joke, some clip from some other Vince Gilligan show or whatnot. That said...

1. Singing for ritual
2. People talking about the weather and such. verbal conversation instead of mind to mind silence.
3. People ready in places in advance of arrivals and other on-time coordination like you see at opening of Episode Two withe motorbike sharing. And arrival bathroom / rebirth to Pirate Lady in ABQ.
4. Travel between continents via air seems a dramatic hive mind theme, also in contrast to train for energy savings / older contrast.
5. I'm not expert on the animal in the ritual circle gathering. But it is held like a child. "A baby goat, regardless of gender, is called a kid, a term derived from Old Norse meaning "young goat," which eventually also came to refer to human children due to the similar playful and curious nature"
