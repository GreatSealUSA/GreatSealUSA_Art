# Pluribus TV Show Reality

My interest in the show is media ecology literacy for the USA society and world. To address the outcomes of Cambridge Analytica and Russia's Internet Research Agency. To address Rupert Murdoch's Fox News, to address Elon Musk Twitter, etc. The popularity and embrace of negative paths for humanity.

### 4 seasons

They are talking about 4 seasons of the show, 2 already approved.

The show can go anywhere! How can we trust the world unchanged, reality itself, the way wars like Russia attacking Ukraine since February 2014 go on. Mental health workers can't seem to address Russia as a nation and convince humanity war is bad.

How can we trust the hive mind isn't being controlled by aliens from outer-space, and once some objective is met, they reprogram the hive mind with new directives?

"The two fundamental human driver when it comes to taking information on board effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are unspoken and the even unconscious -- you didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you," Turnbull explained in a meeting with a reporter posing as "Ranjan," a prospective client from Sri Lanka.  

He continued, "And our job is to get, is to drop the **bucket further down the well than anybody else** to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. There is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's **all about emotion**."
