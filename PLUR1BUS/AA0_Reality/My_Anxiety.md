# My Anxiety

My anxiety at the end of episode 3 is the audience not seeing Carol as the one who asked for a bomb, toyed with a bomb, and set off a bomb. Pepole are blaming the bomb-dealer. 

The bomb cost nothing to Carol. There are no police to stop her. It is no longer illegal. It's just badness. Badness itself.

I don't see people looking at human behavior of Carol, beyond satire / sarcasm / whatever cleverness topics. The bomb was real. The Air Force One was real. There isn't anything int he show that has been about giving a steel metal apple when Carol askes for a fruit to eat. Everything has been non Hyper Real.

## Education / Learning

I see people who like the idea of downloading experience / no more school / education.

This magic upgrade to human minds. 

Yet Carol is not learning by magic downloading, she is learning from eroors and mistakes.

My anxiety is that people aren't seeing tha story. The Finnegans Wake Tower of Babel metaphors. How Joyce created a book that looks like gibirish and nonsense, but actualy has meaning, improtant meanings about human experience of learning.

Audiences, so far, are competing on projecting where the show is heading.

I hope the show addresses the largest issue I see in the world. Shared understanding. The tragedy of the commons on competive comprhension. How Rupert Murdoch programs an audience to hate humanism. How Putin programs a Russian audience to murder neighbors in Ukraine. How religion clergy find hate of other religions, out-group hate, core. Which Joseph Campbell spelled out in 1985 about Pluribus / Great Seal.

": We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them."
