# Describing the Anti-Free-Mason Fandom

Friday, January 2, 2026     

First off, I can't not state this strong or deep enough, no words can get to the main point,

1. Rupert Murdoch Fox News has been around since October 7, 1996

2. Donald Trump has been the center of USA society attention since June 16, 2015.

3. Neil Postman wrote a nonfiction book in 1985 titled "Amusing Ourselves To Death" that is about a second term President in year 1985. It is essential comprehension. It is a short book of 184 pages. Again, is about POTUS.

4. The only time in the Apple TV+ show Pluribus that the word "PLURIBUS" appears or is spoken is on Air Force One in Episode Two. Minute 37 for reference. The image is inauthentic, faked, doctored by the hive mind. 4 stars are missing, the eagle is pointing the wrong way (and the claws are reversed). Repeating, this is the ONLY "PLURIBUS" within the show.

5. Year 2025 was not just Donald Trump but also { RFK Jr, Elon Musk D.O.G.E. in White House, Entertainers from Fox News entertainment network }

6. "WWE stands for World Wrestling Entertainment, and Linda McMahon, a former WWE CEO and leader now serving as U.S. Education Secretary (in the current administration), spent decades in the company before entering politics"

7. The concept of "Celebration of Ignorance" that Carl Sagan descried in his year 1995 book. The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59.

# Mocking and LOL at "whirled peas"

Emphasis on #3 on the list at the top of this page. Neil Postman's book. And the concern of people to be amused and entertained with simulating content above all else. Above world peace: desire for mocking shows, mocking birds, Hunger Games metaphors.

## Free Mason Founding Fathers

It's a joke to year 2026 world. "Whirled Peas", "The Illuminati"

But the Founding Fathers were not joking. They were serious educated men. Year 1988 book, "Power of Myth":

BILL MOYERS: Aren't a lot of these Masonic symbols?

CAMPBELL: They are Masonic signs, and the meaning of the Pythagorean tetrakys has been known for centuries. The information would have been found in Thomas Jefferson's library. These were, after all, learned men. The eighteenth-century Enlightenment was a world of learned gentlemen. We haven't had men of that quality in politics very much. It's an enormous good fortune for our nation that that cluster of gentlemen had the power and were in a position to influence events at that time.

# Impossible to get past the mocking

People prize mocking above prizing world peace. That's the problem. People want to "win debate" with jokes, egoism, contests, and entirely miss the point.

* "**Sober**, modern Occidental judgement is founded on a total misunderstanding of the realities depicted in the fairy tale, **the myth, and the divine comedies of redemption**" - [June 1949 book, chapter 2](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell#The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces_\(1949\))

John Lennon's *Imagine* song is openly mocked in January 2026 in Donald Trump / Rupert Murdoch society. Mocking as entertainment defeats all sincerity. Mocking wins debate, dominates. See #6 on the list at the top of this page. Farce, mocking.

* Molly Hatchet's "Fall of the Peacemakers" was released in 1983 on the album No Guts... No Glory, a powerful Southern rock track reflecting on the tragic loss of leaders like John Lennon, Martin Luther King Jr., and John F. Kennedy, lamenting violence and yearning for peace through haunting lyrics and epic guitar work.

1983 about the mocking of American Dreams of betterment, Pluribus dreams being mocked 'we call him a dreamer' lyrics of 1983. And that is just a couple years before #3 in the list above, book in year 1985 came out.

# Laughed Away Free Masons

* "Love (understood **as the desire of good for another) is in fact so unnatural a phenomenon** that it can scarcely repeat itself, the soul being unable to become virgin again and not having energy enough to cast itself out again into the ocean of another's soul."  - Notes (year 1913) made by James Joyce for his play Exiles

...

* "America was founded by intellectuals, from which it has taken us two centuries and a communications revolution to recover" - Neil Postman

* "But the Founding Fathers did not foresee that tyranny by government might be superseded by another sort of problem altogether, namely, the corporate state, which through television now controls the flow of public discourse in America" - pages 138-139 of the book. It also appears on page 157 in some editions
