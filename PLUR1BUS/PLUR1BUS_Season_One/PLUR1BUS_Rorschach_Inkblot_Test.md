# PLUR1BUS Rorschach Inkblot Test

&nbsp;

Friday, January 2, 2025 morning USA   

I still have no sense of certainty as to what this show intends. Clearly cliffhanger ending of season one was planned and we don't know how long it will be until the second season starts.

The on-screen countdowns and characters all over the world make it very difficult to know that what we have been shown is to be taken at face value. There are loud in-show messages indicating that it may not be a traditional story and could be more of an experimental art project. That the entire show is some kind of lesson about how people read into stories different interpretations. The book tour opening, story within a story, is very complicated.

If you are Carol, given how much the entire world changed in one night, why would you take any person at face value? The only reason she thinks the hive mind does not lie and deceive is because of a few observations. 

The story skips weeks ahead and Carol is doing recreational snow ski trips. It's nearly impossible that she has not learned all kinds of information about what is going on in the world. But we in the audience only get glimpses of what is going on.

What we are shown is that Carol drives around and there are no airplanes or drones in the sky. The roads are empty. Everybody goes to sleep with the lights all out at the same time. We see one single jet take off and go to Peru to deliver the medical package as if, again, air traffic is rare.

Carol implies that wild animals break into buildings to eat art work. People are not sleeping in the houses, people are not running any of the businesses... except the ones to serve the free people when they want something.

The whole ceremony of the girl in Peru was work for them, but as soon as she was done joining the hive, they all stopped like they got off work for the weekend. What is everyone doing in the hive mind? All these empty offices and houses... 

It is implied that all entertainment is no longer important. Sports stars, actors, singers, writers, video game makers, tourism, casinos, hotels, television stations, Internet websites. All that labor and more is just gone. People aren't repairing their recreational cars and houses don't have wear and tear. Cooks no longer needed, meal time very simple now, eating the same food every day is no longer considered bad. 

Every doctor is now a world expert skill level and can jump skills instantly to fix a disease or injury. Schools, teaching, all education activities are now obsolete. Freeing up even more labor and empty buildings. 

What are people doing with all that labor time now? We still know very little.

In the book and film "Ready Player One", people spend all their time on the Internet in an online world. Playing games, watching films, chatting with other people. But the world of Pluribus entertainment and recreation seems entirely obsolete. And Rhea Seehorn made a point in cast interviews that there are  no film or book surprises, everyone now knows every story. https://youtu.be/kFrffEktluo?t=3083 She said that if she were Carol, she would be reading as many books and watching films in her time before she lost the surprise of not knowing endings to stories.

The three people who are in the USA all have no friends or family. One guy is just in Vegas with hive mind strangers. Carol doesn't care about any of her family or any person she knows. Now this guy travels all the way to ABQ alone to meet Carol. But he doesn't care or know about a single person.

What are we to believe here? That Carol's pirate romance stories were essential to life on Earth? If Carol had never wrote those books, exactly what does Carol do that that the world needs?

* "Nihilism is a family of philosophical views arguing that life is meaningless, that moral values are baseless, or that knowledge is impossible. Thus, such views reject the basis of certain ideas."

Is this intentional on the part of the show creators, or did they just end up creating 9 episodes that painted such a story on the way to a long wait until another 9 episodes for a second season.

I don't think this show is entertainment. I think season one of Pluribus is a work of art like Rorschach Inkblot Test. How the audience reacts to the Rorschach images, how people react to the show, is very useful. You can turn it into all kinds of education topics about storytelling.

What does a world do without vanity and ownership. 

But then the clock jumping. They can put the clock up on the screen and show us things happened on a certain day in one part of the world and it entirely changes the story. We simply do not know very much.

Which puts me back to season one being a Rorschach Inkblot Test. 

Which is the only reason I am here on Reddit. Because the Dollar Bill, the currency that every American has held in their hands or in their pocket... has that word "Pluribus" on it from Free Masons ideas from the year 1776. And I have traveled all over the USA and I have never met a single American, not even on Reddit or Twitter or Facebook who ever asked what the word Pluribus meant.

... Or *asked why* isn't there a pyramid monument in Washington D.C. with an eye at the top of the pyramid. Las Vegas has a hotel like a pyramid, but not one person has any curiosity at all to bother to ask even the most basic questions about what the Free Masons were trying to say with the Latin words and eagle and pyramid and other symbols.

People simply do not know. Total ignorance. A wildcard. Rorschach Inkblot Test. What's the meaning? You won't find a "Reddit Today I Learned" and it is on every fucking Dollar Bill.

I think Vince Gilligan is the only person in the entire world to notice that everyone is blind as a bat and has zero curiosity to ever ask a teacher or anyone where the pyramid is.

We are living in a Rorschach Inkblot Test that everyone seems blind to. What were the Free Masons saying.

I started asking that question in year 2009 and I never stopped asking that question. The ignorance is amazing. People wave the god damn USA red white and blue flag around every day and not one single person on Reddit has ever read one page in a book about what the Free Masons created with that pyramid and eagle and Latin language.

If I had Vince Gilligan's talents, *I* would have made this television show.

I have known what "PLURIBUS" Latin word means since year 1988, the year I graduated high school. But in all of Reddit, I can not find ONE SINGLE person who has read the books I read. Rorschach Inkblot Test
