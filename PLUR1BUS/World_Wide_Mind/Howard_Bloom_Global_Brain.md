# Howard Bloom: Global Brain

Published August 2000:

"Howard Bloom's Global Brain argues that life has evolved as a "worldwide learning machine" or "global brain," with each species playing a role in a massive, interconnected system. This isn't a new phenomenon but an evolutionary process dating back to early bacterial colonies, which continued through social animals like spiny lobsters and bees, and is now manifesting in human society and digital networks. The book proposes that culture and society are not just byproducts of individual evolution but are shaped by a "mass mind" that tests ideas through group selection and competition, with technology like the internet being a recent step in this long history. " - Google A.I. summary. I've been studying this book since year 2015
