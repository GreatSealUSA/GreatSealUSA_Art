 # Joseph Campbell Hivd Mind

 A lot of people think that the "free thinking" have a purpose / agenda. That humanity isn't motivated by competittion, war, slavery / enslavement, corporate, religion leaders / clergy, etc.

 Campbell expressed a view that without a "God" directing us, or our own *imagined God* ideas, our own creation of Eden and Heaven (Campbell was an atheist, metaphor believer but not a beleiver in any one religion)...

 Virus on Earth spreads, but does it "reproduce"? Or parasitic reproduce. If the hive mind wanted to grow in size / expand. So far in Episode 3, we haven't seen children. But the show has not given us much information yet.

 Is Vance Gilligan being anti-Bliss of Campbell?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It’s a magnificent idea—an idea that appears in India in the mythic image of the Net of Indra, which is a net of gems, where at every crossing of one thread over another there is a gem reflecting all the other reflective gems. Everything arises in mutual relation to everything else, so you can’t blame anybody for anything. It is even as though there were a single intention behind it all, which always makes some kind of sense, though none of us knows what the sense might be, or has lived the life that he quite intended.

BILL MOYERS: And yet we all have lived a life that had a purpose. Do you believe that?

CAMPBELL: **I don’t believe life has a purpose. Life is a lot of protoplasm with an urge to reproduce and continue in being**.

MOYERS: Not true—not true.

CAMPBELL: Wait a minute. Just sheer life cannot be said to have a purpose, because look at all the different purposes it has all over the place. But each incarnation, you might say, has a potentiality, and the mission of life is to live that potentiality. How do you do it? My answer is, “Follow your bliss.” There’s something inside you that knows when you’re in the center, that knows when you’re on the beam or off the beam. And if you get off the beam to earn money, you’ve lost your life. And if you stay in the center and don’t get any money, you still have your bliss.
