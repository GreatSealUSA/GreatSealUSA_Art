# The Best Information

I see people acting like the only interpretation is Carol's current one (epside 2). Evenon Air Force One they all poiint out to Carol that she has not asked people what it was like.

I don't see evidence people have givne up their individuality post-upgrade. Why would you pick a TGIF employee to fly, was it her dream?

What I see is perfect information system (other than the Carol caused crashes).

When you can now watch any film / TV show / book in your head in a rapid delivery experince... like The Matrix cable into the skull, but now wireless global....

That changes behaviors. You no longer need to go to any movie cinema or book store. Nolongerneedschools, the child demonstrates that.

The show may even blow up it's own universe with this perfect information sharing, because it is far bigger of a topic than mind slavery.

From a biological technology perspective, being able to peer with another brain and hand over entire experinces such as how to fly - is cosmos-changing. Carol's only concern seems to be the choice / consent issue. I don't think she has pondered the power of KEEPING that technology! You free all children from education as we know it.

If you forget something, like where Carol keeps the spare key, it's NOTICED that you forget.

This kind of upgrade to life is staggering.
