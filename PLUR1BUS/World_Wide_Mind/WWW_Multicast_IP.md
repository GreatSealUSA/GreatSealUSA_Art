# WWW Multicast IP 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_multicast

Right now, every person starts their Netflix and YouTube show / Apple TV+ show at their own time.

It is streamed over TCP/IP to each individual subscriber, so that they can pause and rewind and skip ahead as they desire.

In a hive mind, all that disappears. People all tune in at the same time... The massive bandwidth to send the same episode of "Better Call Saul" to 100 people all on different pages is now cut down to 1 single multicast stream.

In IP multicast, you can subscribe and unsubscribe from invidual channels. If you are a medical doctor, tune into that portion of the multicast channel.
