"I appreciated that bit of realism, after the first 5 minutes kind of turned me off. The VLA people receive a signal and act like it's something bizarre when it's just 4-level FSK at a nice round 400 baud."

A very common misconception. The mental illness is on Truth Social and Fox News HDTV. The audience of Rupert Murdoch has mass psychosis mental illness. We have educational science to educate and diagnose people with mass psychosis, but people instead profit off treating one Fox News HDTV viewer at a time for $180/hour instead of diagnosing the entire cable network system.
