"I've also thought about uncontacted tribes. I think it's reasonable to think that there are people who aren't connected to Earth's general population, so there are still people unaccounted for."

Answer 1: In episode 2, when Pirate Lady meets Carol at her gate / outside Carol's house... a military drone is disclosed as how the hive mind is observing Carol. It is established that drones are part of their interaction with the free thinking people.

Answer 2: Air delivery seems to have been the "final solution" for humanity takeover. And submarines, space station, and other isolated places with technical independence were targeted in earlier stages of spreading. Air delivery coudl target isolated tribes, people still go outdoors.

Answer 3: Once infected people would use the kissing (like fast-acting Herpes Simplex?) sharing. ToDo: When Carol takes Helen to the hospital, doesn't the doctor kiss Carol / uninfected arrival?
