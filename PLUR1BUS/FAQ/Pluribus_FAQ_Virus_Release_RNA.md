"I've also thought about uncontacted tribes. I think it's reasonable to think that there are people who aren't connected to Earth's general population, so there are still people unaccounted for."

Answer 1: In episode 2, when Pirate Lady meets Carol at her gate / outside Carol's house... a military drone is disclosed as how the hive mind is observing Carol. It is established that drones are part of their interaction with the free thinking people. Drones are also used later for trash pickup / outgoing letters and packages in ineractinc with the free thinkers.

Answer 2: Air delivery seems to have been the "final solution" for humanity takeover. And submarines, space station, and other isolated places with technical independence were targeted in earlier stages of spreading. Air delivery coudl target isolated tribes, people still go outdoors.

Answer 3: Once infected people would use the kissing (like fast-acting Herpes Simplex?) sharing. ToDo: When Carol takes Helen to the hospital, doesn't the doctor kiss Carol / uninfected arrival?

## One Rat

Suggested name for the rat.

"The BINGO rat". They were testing many rats, this rat called BINGO first. Also a Better Call Saul reference of BINGO games.

There is a more subtle meaning: This particular rat "went dead" unlike the others. Zoning out / shutting down seems to be part of the human behavior when infected. Like how everyone was at the bar at minute 22 of Episode One. Carol froze, the woman on the telephone behind the bar was locked, people all over the bar frozen. The rat seemed to be the only one inejected that had this behavior.

This raises questions: Were all the rats being given the same test payload? Was the shot different content for each rat? Was each batch of testing (ongoing or months) a new RNA / mRNA / ??? brew?
