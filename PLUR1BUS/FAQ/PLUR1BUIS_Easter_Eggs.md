# PLUR1BUS Easter Eggs

Whenever they go into "trivia fact" about years or Latin words - listen up! Do research.

Every one of them has had *Easter Egg* meanings. When the hand grenade is delivered to Carol's house, the hive mind does another one of those Wikipedia fact citations about the Latin word for vodka. https://youtu.be/j0spmMtmliU?t=123 "Pluribus | Carol And Zosia Share A Drink" **"Fun Fact"** That's another Easter Egg in the show!

* Rewind to Episode One Minute 22 when **Finnegans Wake book** by James Joyce is introduced at the Zero Hour by Helen as graduate work. The "Water of Life" is how Tim Finnegan is brought back from the dead. So this hive mind Wikipedia mind "FUN FACT" is a book reference / song reference. In a story about book selling, book touring, book authoring, book fandom!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegan%27s_Wake_(song)#Summary     

":: Whiskey causes both Finnegan's fall and his resurrection—whiskey is derived from the **Irish phrase uisce beatha** (pronounced [ˈɪʃcə ˈbʲahə]), meaning "water of life" :::"

&nbsp;

Helen cracks her skull like Tim Finnegan when she falls at the Minute 22 of Episode One, the Zero Hour "00:00:00:00" time. OPERA_A Tim is a brick man, just another Brick in the Catholic Church wall in Dublin or USA singsong. Just another nobody man working for *The Man*. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6PwUG283DU ... *poetry* / *music lyrics, sing song* .... 15,369,148 views March 1, 2022

# What year is the Spit card game?

In Season One, card games at the West Gate Vegas Hotel with the Elvis Suite. Then a home game "Spit" is introduced with a hive mind Wikipedia hive mind trivia "FUN FACT".

"Spit appears to have originated in the UK in the 1980s."

1. RED FLAG: Carol is an American, she does not live in London. She played it as a child and she is a USA person.

2. RED FLAG: In the years of the 1980's. Wrong!

Research, the Pluribus in-show hive mind with the Wikipedia hive mind:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spit_(card_game)

"1973 book Deal Me In! The Use of Playing Cards in Learning and Teaching by Margie Golick, who was based at McGill University, Montreal."

* "the university bears the name of James McGill"

   * Author of book (Margie Golick) being tied to that university seems legit. https://www.McGill.ca/continuingstudies/channels/event/life-and-rhymes-margie-golick-238920

         * "Margie Golick has helped learning happen for more than 40 years as a psychologist, **television consultant**" - https://www.pembrokepublishers.com/bio.cgi?id=35

    * For me, this is one fucking wild Ride surfing the WWW! https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/montreal-gazette-mcluhans-legacy-alive-and-tweeting-175987  "Montreal Gazette - McLuhan's legacy: Alive and **tweeting**" --- Minute 22 of  Pluribus Episode One, Helen's Graduate School work is on James Joyce's Finnegans Wake.  "::: “He seemed a kind of embarrassing holdover from 1960s hyped-up **utopian thinking**. In the 1980s, the cutting-edge of media studies **for grad students involved thinking about identity (gender, race, etc.)** and not much about media,” said Straw, a communication studies professor and director of McGill University’s Institute for the Study of Canada :::." - Published: 17 July 2011

           * "Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966 .. (Again, asserting Minute 22 of Episode One of Pluribus)

           *  Vince Gilligan called social media (Twitter obviously inclusive) a "cesspool" at the writers guild speech February 15, 2025

* "Saul Goodman (Jimmy McGill) has one brother, Charles "Chuck" McGill, a highly respected but deeply resentful corporate lawyer whose toxic relationship and sabotage of Jimmy's career in Better Call Saul are a major catalyst for Jimmy's transformation into the infamous Saul Goodman, ultimately leading to Chuck's suicide and Jimmy's full embrace of his criminal persona.

"Even the day dreamers seem to pick up speed when they play Spit."

* This quote does indeed seem legit, page 60, from the year 1973 book. https://books.google.com/books?id=wxUPAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Even+the+day+dreamers+seem+to+pick+up+speed+when+they+play+Spit.%22&dq=%22Even+the+day+dreamers+seem+to+pick+up+speed+when+they+play+Spit.%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&printsec=frontcover&sa=X
