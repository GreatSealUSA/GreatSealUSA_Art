My commentary: The Black Mirror show at 18 minutes introduces LCD / acid. Pluribus has indirectly invoked acid trips (LSD specifically) at the zero hour. "00:00:00:00" in the countdown at the public house by Helen to Carol at minute 22 of Pluribus Episode One. Since the fandom of Vince Gilligan's show is drawn to the topic of substance abuse (Walter White blue meth), it is important to consider the known associations. Carol has a DUI device on her automobile. Chemical dependence, substance abuse, recreational drugs and drinking. Altered states of mind. 

Finnegans Wake, which Helen introduces at the zero hour... is about drinking in a Public House, Earwicker's Pub. Carol and Helen were in a Public House, the very one in ABQ where Walter White has been laid to rest. Finnegans Wake also means *funeral wake*. In a story about book tours, book authoring, book writing, book selling, book fandoms... bring up a book at the "00:00:00:00" time I suggest should be taken seriously. I'm going round and round on this topic because page 628 of Finnegans Wake book does just that.

1. Inside Finnegans Wake story: drunk, alcohol, inebriation

2. Outside Finnegans Wake: the author James Joyce was a drunkard like Carol.

3. Outside Finnegans Wake: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QrWfbYFtNk "Terence McKenna saw parallels between the complex, linguistic density of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake and the overwhelming, archetypal visions from psilocybin mushrooms, viewing both as "alien" languages or code that unlocked deeper consciousness, using his **"Stoned Ape" theory to link mushrooms** to human evolution"

4. The one I consider most important to Braking Bad AMC television to Apple TV+ streaming Pluribus... Marshall McLuhan's key statement I have devoted a website to: www.LazyWake.com University of Toronto, media study: "(Audience question) have you ever taken LSD? (Answer) No. I've thought about it and I talked with many people who have taken it. And I have the read Finnegans Wake aloud at a time when takers of LSD said 'that is just like LSD!' So, I began to feel that LSD may just be the lazy man's form of Finnegans Wake"
