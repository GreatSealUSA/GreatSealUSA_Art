My Interpretation Context Assertion: 

"Manousos' Chunga Palm Injury Was Planned By The Hive, & The Plane Poves It!"

"Manousos spent all of Pluribus refusing the Hive. He wouldn’t take their water, wouldn’t take their transport, and he’d rather burn his own car than owe them anything. Then Episode 7 hits him with the chunga palm—spines, bacteria, infection, collapse… and a Hive rescue helicopter.

Here’s the terrifying theory: the Hive’s invasive stem-cell procedure requires consent, but Manousos losing consciousness creates an “emergency loophole.” The Hive can frame everything as life-saving care—sedation, tests, samples—while quietly getting the biological access they need to tailor conversion anyway."
