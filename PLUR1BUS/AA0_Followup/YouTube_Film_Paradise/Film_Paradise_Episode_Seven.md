My Interpretation Context Assertion: 

"Manousos' Chunga Palm Injury Was Planned By The Hive, & The Plane Poves It!"

"Manousos spent all of Pluribus refusing the Hive. He wouldn’t take their water, wouldn’t take their transport, and he’d rather burn his own car than owe them anything. Then Episode 7 hits him with the chunga palm—spines, bacteria, infection, collapse… and a Hive rescue helicopter.

Here’s the terrifying theory: the Hive’s invasive stem-cell procedure requires consent, but Manousos losing consciousness creates an “emergency loophole.” The Hive can frame everything as life-saving care—sedation, tests, samples—while quietly getting the biological access they need to tailor conversion anyway."

# Default Settings 

https://youtu.be/ve7API5VWEk?t=249    
"That tells you his default setting is: distrust"     

1. Emphasis on water / hydration of He / Him. And Episode Two with Carol digging grave water hydration. "Water Of Life" Finnegans Wake (Minute Twenty Two (Kepler 22B) of Episode One Helen's post-doc thesis: James Joyce summary of Portrait of an Art itself): "This Is Water" [April 14, 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Water) - an answer to standing still waters [the 1968 Media Ecology challenge presented by Marshall McLuhan / University of Toronto about Finnegans Wake self-awareness](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/187497-one-thing-about-which-fish-know-exactly-nothing-is-water). ... ... ... "This Is Water" April 14, 2009 David Foster Wallace "basic **self-centredness** because it’s so socially repulsive. But it’s pretty much the same for all of us. **It is our default setting**, hard-wired into our boards at birth."

2. Story Settings, Default Settings, Spanish language is from Spain, after year 1492 in The Americas. Just as Carol's "English First" Language is not Americas. [Global Village Dublin Metaphors Abound of Language Ecology year 1968 via North Polling Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace_in_the_Global_Village) - his learning English on his travels is the traps of Joyce's book. Re-asserting the traps of Kepler-22B - Minute Twenty Two of Episode One and Helen's post-doctorate Pluribus thesis of Finn's Hotel year 1923 over Walter White's grave Wake Funeral.

# Mixers of Water of Life

"Mojito pouch"  
Tim Finnegan's Mixers of Water of Life.

1. Muddle the knowledge tree leaves of Eden. Applied technique / technology to the leaves of fruits. Middle the mint. Muddle the MonoMyth tales. There's a twist in your Joycean tale. https://youtu.be/1oqOrI8yK-4?t=125 "you're lying on [the corner of Merchant's Quay](https://fwannotated.blogspot.com/2014/09/eve-and-adam-in-fw.html)... Telling the World how it's meant to be"

2. "Zafiro Añejo tequila for big moments, but fans also associate cocktails with the show, sometimes referencing popular drinks like the Moscow Mule Kim orders, or even the vibe of a "**Morning Mojito"** as a nod to the show's New Mexico setting and characters like Nacho Varga (Mijo)." (Jeremiah Bitsui) - Google Search summary 2025-12-16 morning USA

3. "Another theory is that the name Mojito is simply a derivative of mojadito (Spanish for "lightly wet"), the diminutive of mojado ("wet")" - Google Search summary 2025-12-16 morning USA. "And to help him on with his work each day He'd a drop of the craythur every morn" ... ... ... metaphors of "creature comforts" historical "water of life" (uisge beatha) concepts... "craythur" a playful term for potent drinks. Fast-breaking morning, rituals of fasting, rituals of Funeral Wake mourners (oral meaning / acoustic space overload language) - the independent free thinkers mourners loss of The Enlightenment thinking to the hive mind. Walter White's grave yard, Helen's Fall, Minute Twenty Two and all of Episode One. OPERA_A In the Morning he goes gunning for the men who stole Tim's water, My Civic Ditty to link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1wNA5PnKQ crossing the borders south to north and back again. And they put Tim Finnegan ladder climber back on the street... Finnegans Wake iterates, circular recursive pages turning.

# My Context Expansions

1. Metaphors of Eden and not eating the fruit of total knowledge of humanity, the hive mind.

2. Steely Dan King of The World { Darien Gap, Panama Canal, to Rio Grande River Last man Standing, Santa Fe New Mexico car tour ruins, New Mexico atomic bomb origins / Carol atomic bomb processing, Plains of Saint Augustine New Mexico Array 78-second signal, "Countdown to" on-screen beat counting album title, Poison Wine drinking mixing metaphor cocktails, Carol's virgin lungs and Cobalt-60 fallout (smoking mother nature, plants, rolling papers / Joyce 1924 (streaming book) [rolling release](http://www.steelydan.nl/concerts.jsp?SearchTour=2007) "countdown to" ) } https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOGWbaOOeCM

3. Ship Piracy of Earth for Oil. Joyce Language Babel Asserts in The Wake. The Gas Station Christmas season Carol - the gas can drinking from cars, refilling and language recirculations. Jungle greens to underground concentrates. ReCycle and eating. https://old.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1po3bgc/whats_gasoline_called_in_each_european_country/ - gasoline in mouth, fire water metaphors of Carol's boozing and Tim's ladder fall abound.

4. "Eating your own dog food" from the storage units. Metaphors for language learning. John 1:1 origins, mankind creating the oral tradition and the paper book John 1:1 is printed on (McLuhan ecology). He is eating humankind's own lording over animals with canning factory input and what we feed our animal nature neighbors. The Apple //+ world metaphors (your writer here on GitHub worked in Bellevue Washington, in the Bellevue Riot House Jimi Hendrix Rock Opera Museum development.. of Popularity Culture days) of medium ecology. "The phrase "eating your own dog food" (or "dogfooding") means using your own company's products to test them, originating from pet food ads (Lorne Greene for Alpo) and possibly a Kal Kan president eating his own product, but **[popularized in tech](https://www.mopop.org/exhibitions/jimi-hendrix) by Microsoft's Paul** Maritz in 1988 to push internal use, solidifying it as using what you sell for authenticity and quality." - Google Search summary 2025-12-16 morning. Hendrix And all that Jazz of Bellevue Almost Famous metaphors.
