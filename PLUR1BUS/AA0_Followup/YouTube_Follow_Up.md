She is Campbell's secondary kind of hero, to revitalize the meaning of Heaven for Levant religions. Vance Gilligant revitalizing the Levant traditions... modernizing food codes / dress / beyond the war-torn. "There is a kind of secondary hero to revitalize the tradition. This hero reinterprets the tradition and makes it valid as a living experience today instead of a lot of outdated clichés. This has to be done with all traditions."

@4:50 - the only thing I found you skipped as a book editor, was Helen dropping Finnegans Wake on the conversation in a "Public House" (setting for Wake) and saying statement about making even single person happy. The James Joyce thunder-bomb. Helen then Falls backwards and cracks her head like Tim Finnegan. https://youtu.be/kOD0jMWFLlQ?t=708 year 2016 timeline prediction based on clothes.

Carol is from outer-space family escaping a wipeout.  Twilight Zone is lead-in to the show.

Did they license the character to make a sequel?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvgBlLMBs-I

Carol's book. https://youtu.be/TvgBlLMBs-I?t=314 Carol keeps killing her book character. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvgBlLMBs-I  Carol's 5th book white board notes. This time kill her *for real*. https://youtu.be/TvgBlLMBs-I?t=690 predictions. Temporal compass.

## Channel 4 Real-y Good Reviews

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Q7FSmSzR8

Carol as monster. Messy, angry, irrational, rage is proof of life.  https://youtu.be/I7Q7FSmSzR8?t=135  Anti-consent. https://youtu.be/I7Q7FSmSzR8?t=281 ChatGPT https://youtu.be/I7Q7FSmSzR8?t=387 The funamental lie that relationships are built on. Helen never told Carol truths. Some truths destroy more than they heal. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9UYImWVR9I

Episode 5, they called her "She" in the Hive Mind.

I wonder if Zosia knows English. Her multi-lingual at the airport with Air Force One... was hive mind ability? And when she stumbled for words she has lost access to English.

### Episode 7, Lucky 7 step to 13 Lucky

After Episode Seven https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcIj6TnjQGs "Just Married", "ACEBABY", eggs / ice / immigrants. https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=102 "from your body" https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=161 "Carol's Eggs are Fallen Apples" https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=192 excellent "data protection" metaphors - digital footprint / writing book footprint - given how Carol has been a "Wall Facer" with paper notes. https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=207 you can harvest stem cells in lab after 4 to 7 days. https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=253 language of film visual storytelling. Approaching like down a wedding in a church in slow hesitance showing off / pregnancy reveal. (Also like a wounded animal who was at the scene of a murder-suicide Jihadi Carol attempt). https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=266 40 day story bump, baby bump. (another at-home bomb delivery by hive mind to Carol's house, hive mind priority to birth new children, Carol's DNA or otherwise). https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=287 "He's planting visual seeds" (Youtuber should emphasize scene of crime house / trap house booze bomb, jihad murder/suicide attempt) https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=373 mother milk metaphors. Also Zosha's milk truck opening scene was a LEVANT emphasizing - Torah / Islam / Bible context science fiction. - In fiction story of Jesus, did Mary get a choice of pregnancy from outer space Eden? https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=407 "forcing a union through prenancy"

me: Georgia - Georgia. Outer-space satellites. forcing a marriage shotgun wedding on a woman. OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WonOudGMSdc free "Milk" and a Carton and a Cow, don't use metaphors ;)


me: I haven't typed notes from my head since 2.5 days ago of watching virgin episode viewing. so some of my notes were my own observations I'm inlining from links to this YouTube video. Hybrid of my own and the YouTube channel's observations just because I didn't do much in the MythNotes S01E07 page.


me: Christmas Day Eve ending, immaculate conception, Vince Gilligan doesn't do accidents in scheduling. WGA writing / authoring put on notice year begin lecture / speech about sexy bad guys.RNA from outer space Eden to impregnate a virgin (lesbian) woman. For rebirth of society. An alien / illegal alien / kepler-22b alien pregnancy of 1 of the 13 free thinkers / free will. Her husbandry partner traveling to help like Joseph the non-sex virgin fathering? Metaphors of storytelling surrogate womb / I.C.E. immigrants (show title = April 2021 President Bush book title). uterus of a gestational carrier, message carrier. 

me: "Carol's Eggs are Fallen Apples" is a great sentence and metaphors. Eve fallen from Eden, apple being the humanity fruit (Torah doesn't say, Apple specific, confirm?) - Apple computers mythology knowledge falling from the tree of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (Helen's post-doctorate thesis: Minute 22 Episode One) metaphors reformations. The Fall of Helen cracks her skull dead / nondead Helen knowledge tree. **Science knowledge** of humanity, the origins of John 1:1 authoring of our stories (including Pluribus Founding Fathers authoring of Great Seal science path to egg freezing technology). the Founding Fathers reject the fall of mankind and pluck eggs from the body if free will / consent / and desires of the woman. Cosmic egg metaphors abound. OPERA_A The Egg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI maybe God looks like "Pirate Lady" https://youtu.be/h6fcK_fRYaI?t=91 marriage to Helen falling apart?

me: 40 days. Very very very significant science fiction number. Alien birth story science fiction. 40 days and nights of rain during Noah's flood (Genesis 7:12), Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 34:28), Jesus' temptation in the wilderness (Matthew 4:2, Luke 4:2), and the 40 days between Jesus' resurrection and ascension (Acts 1:3) - Levant monomyth science fiction opcodes.

ASSERT_BIG_PICTURE: Are we breeding a founding MOTHERS mythology for the Great Seal year 250 USA year 2026 eve / winter solstice of science? Hybrid fiction and nonfiction science egg freezing parallels to immigrants and world merge sorting of RNA to DNA?
