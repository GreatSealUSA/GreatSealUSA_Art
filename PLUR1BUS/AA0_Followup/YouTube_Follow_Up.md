This hero reinterprets the tradition and makes it valid as a living experience today instead of a lot of outdated clichés. This has to be done with all traditions."

@4:50 - the only thing I found you skipped as a book editor, was Helen dropping Finnegans Wake on the conversation in a "Public House" (setting for Wake) and saying statement about making even single person happy. The James Joyce thunder-bomb. Helen then Falls backwards and cracks her head like Tim Finnegan. https://youtu.be/kOD0jMWFLlQ?t=708 year 2016 timeline prediction based on clothes.

Episode 5, they called her "She" in the Hive Mind.

I wonder if Zosia knows English. Her multi-lingual at the airport with Air Force One... was hive mind ability? And when she stumbled for words she has lost access to English.

### Episode 7, Lucky 7 step to 13 Lucky

After Episode Seven https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcIj6TnjQGs "Just Married", "ACEBABY", eggs / ice / immigrants. https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=102 "from your body" https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=161 "Carol's Eggs are Fallen Apples" https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=192 excellent "data protection" metaphors - digital footprint / writing book footprint - given how Carol has been a "Wall Facer" with paper notes. https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=207 you can harvest stem cells in lab after 4 to 7 days. https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=253 language of film visual storytelling. Approaching like down a wedding in a church in slow hesitance showing off / pregnancy reveal. (Also like a wounded animal who was at the scene of a murder-suicide Jihadi Carol attempt). https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=266 40 day story bump, baby bump. (another at-home bomb delivery by hive mind to Carol's house, hive mind priority to birth new children, Carol's DNA or otherwise). https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=287 "He's planting visual seeds" (Youtuber should emphasize scene of crime house / trap house booze bomb, jihad murder/suicide attempt) https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=373 mother milk metaphors. Also Zosha's milk truck opening scene was a LEVANT emphasizing - Torah / Islam / Bible context science fiction. - In fiction story of Jesus, did Mary get a choice of pregnancy from outer space Eden?
https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=407 "forcing a union through pregnancy" https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=589 Carol is drowning. the fireworks to the face in public. https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=722 Helen's loss, the Helen Carol baby connection, Carol's own child being a child custody battle metaphor. Saul the child custody lawyer thees abound. "The impossible choice" of harming your own child (a metaphor of the lifestyle of Helen and Carol jet-setting DINK childless USA over-consumption Saul and Mr. white leaderships. That melting disposable ice bed (FOR WEALTHY) climate change future of humanity harming children. Carol's gas station ice drink games of wealth and power.).
https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=736 "No clean exit" (oh boy, "NO EXIT" - Hell is other humans hive mind metaphors) https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=759 Carol jihadi murder-suicide bombed an African immigrant, and then set her own house on fire as a native american smoke signal metaphor - like burning his own car. https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=811 "Let me compile all the evidence:" It's Saul language metaphors. Lawyer language manipulations. Author confronts John 1:1 / speaking on equal terms with the public language (Joyce Finn's Hotel 1923) - metaphors of Bitter Wake Carol's unpublished work in progress. this YouTube section is all about linguistics and word choice of John 1:1  (and let's not forget that the actress context ABQ metaphors of audience associations, media ecology of McLuhan on TV and Finn's Hotel 1923 book) 
https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=894 biological imperative of slave pets. How humans "fix" cats and dogs to control pregnancy and behavior through biological science (Walter White science, military lab rat medical science badness breaking out) https://youtu.be/LcIj6TnjQGs?t=1007 "The fandom is a hive mind, and Gilligan is playing to that" - not random any more than my copypasta and Finnegans wake (Minute 22 post-doc thesis of Episode One) isn't random. "With Gilligan, it's probably all three" (Trinity, and what Jean E. said in Coach With Six Insides about meaning of Finnegans Wake having 20)

me: Georgia - Georgia. Outer-space satellites. forcing a marriage shotgun wedding on a woman. OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WonOudGMSdc free "Milk" and a Carton and a Cow, don't use metaphors ;)


me: I haven't typed notes from my head since 2.5 days ago of watching virgin episode viewing. so some of my notes were my own observations I'm inlining from links to this YouTube video. Hybrid of my own and the YouTube channel's observations just because I didn't do much in the MythNotes S01E07 page.

ToDo in another page: "I could have save a hundred grand" - is cultural programming, could have had a v8, could have had a hundred grand bar. Media ecology of Banksy and product placement (the brand of drink at the gas station in episode seven). Banksy banking eggs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Grand_Bar "Bar" Public house, add to the REDDIT copypasta hive-mind Reddit stand-up comedy (George Carlin audience stand up on truth). 100 grand in a bar boozing away instead of ice beds. Also words of "cold storage' and slammer for drinking, ice storage of disappeared immigrants, hot storage in TEXAS of immigrants. Booze cold storage bar bottle fetching another from "behind the bar" "in storage' because of Carol's high consumption / disease of consumption metaphors / heavy drinking cold storage. 

me: Christmas Day Eve ending, immaculate conception, Vince Gilligan doesn't do accidents in scheduling. WGA writing / authoring put on notice year begin lecture / speech about sexy bad guys.RNA from outer space Eden to impregnate a virgin (lesbian) woman. For rebirth of society. An alien / illegal alien / kepler-22b alien pregnancy of 1 of the 13 free thinkers / free will. Her husbandry partner traveling to help like Joseph the non-sex virgin fathering? Metaphors of storytelling surrogate womb / I.C.E. immigrants (show title = April 2021 President Bush book title). uterus of a gestational carrier, message carrier. 

me: "Carol's Eggs are Fallen Apples" is a great sentence and metaphors. Eve fallen from Eden, apple being the humanity fruit (Torah doesn't say, Apple specific, confirm?) - Apple computers mythology knowledge falling from the tree of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (Helen's post-doctorate thesis: Minute 22 Episode One) metaphors reformations. The Fall of Helen cracks her skull dead / nondead Helen knowledge tree. **Science knowledge** of humanity, the origins of John 1:1 authoring of our stories (including Pluribus Founding Fathers authoring of Great Seal science path to egg freezing technology). the Founding Fathers reject the fall of mankind and pluck eggs from the body if free will / consent / and desires of the woman. Cosmic egg metaphors abound. OPERA_A The Egg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI maybe God looks like "Pirate Lady" https://youtu.be/h6fcK_fRYaI?t=91 marriage to Helen falling apart?

me: 40 days. Very very very significant science fiction number. Alien birth story science fiction. 40 days and nights of rain during Noah's flood (Genesis 7:12), Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 34:28), Jesus' temptation in the wilderness (Matthew 4:2, Luke 4:2), and the 40 days between Jesus' resurrection and ascension (Acts 1:3) - Levant monomyth science fiction opcodes.

ASSERT_BIG_PICTURE: Are we breeding a founding MOTHERS mythology for the Great Seal year 250 USA year 2026 eve / winter solstice of science? Hybrid fiction and nonfiction science egg freezing parallels to immigrants and world merge sorting of RNA to DNA?

https://youtu.be/8h46Ywf0VOA?t=118 Season one: Cold War metaphors. https://youtu.be/8h46Ywf0VOA?t=178 Show detractors cluster into two very predictable camps. https://youtu.be/8h46Ywf0VOA?t=251 Narrative about the evasive nature of power and control. How thin moral language can become. https://youtu.be/8h46Ywf0VOA?t=312 Carol is attempting to negotiate with an impersonal system that controls the enviornment.

* "MOYERS By doing what? CAMPBELL: By holding to your own ideals for yourself and, like Luke Skywalker, rejecting the system’s impersonal claims upon you." - 1988, Power Of Myth, nonfiction learning.

https://youtu.be/8h46Ywf0VOA?t=353 this is what happens when a society stops appreciating books. The book authoring / book publishing / book fandom themes of the story.

https://youtu.be/8h46Ywf0VOA?t=394 Show not written like a theme-park ride. 

https://youtu.be/8h46Ywf0VOA?t=422 Trained by a decade of Twitter-think. Spark notes. Instant gratification.

https://youtu.be/8h46Ywf0VOA?t=452 The show is about this basic problem. Media ecology itself, audience confrontation. The audience is being addressed. Soft power.

https://youtu.be/8h46Ywf0VOA?t=496 These moments are the meticulous writing setup of the audience.

https://youtu.be/8h46Ywf0VOA?t=535 The Title Latin word is an explicit reference to the Great Seal of the Untied States of America. Politics is front and center!

https://youtu.be/8h46Ywf0VOA?t=584 Mechanical unity. (Biologically engineered, Marshall McLuhan's book "Mechanical Bride" themes) 

* "JOSEPH CAMPBELL: [Ortega y Gasset talks about the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ortega_y_Gasset) environment and the hero in his Meditations on Don Quixote. Don Quixote was the last hero of the Middle Ages. He rode out to encounter giants, but instead of giants, his environment produced windmills. Ortega points out that this story takes place about the time that a **mechanistic interpretation of the world** came in, so that the environment was no longer spiritually responsive to the hero. The hero is today running up against a **hard world that is in no way responsive to his spiritual need**. MOYERS: A windmill. CAMPBELL: Yes, but Quixote saved the adventure for himself by inventing a magician who had just transformed the giants he had gone forth to encounter into windmills. You can do that, too, if you have a poetic imagination. Earlier, though, it was not **a mechanistic world** in which the hero moved but a world alive and responsive to his spiritual readiness. Now it has become to such an extent a sheerly mechanistic world, as interpreted through our physical sciences, Marxist sociology, and behavioristic psychology, that we’re nothing but a **predictable pattern of wires responding to stimuli**. This nineteenth-century interpretation has squeezed the freedom of the human will out of modern life. MOYERS: In the **political sense**..."

EVERY GENERATION DESERVES THEIR OWN MYTHS, MYTHOLOGY!!!!

* "Shakespeare said that art is a mirror held up to nature. And that’s what it is. The nature is your nature, and all of these wonderful **poetic images of mythology** are referring to something in you. When your mind is simply trapped by the image out there so that you never make the reference to yourself, you have misread the image."  - [The Power of Myth, year 1988 book, Page 68](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA68&dq=%22When+your+mind+is+simply+trapped+by+the+image+out+there%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

intellect pre-existing intellectual property and it feels obviously it feels wonderful uh to be allowed to do that I feel very grateful feel like I won the lottery. And then I think about it and I think it kind of makes me feel sad too because there should be it shouldn't be that exceptional that special uh uh an opportunity to get to create something new uh versus something you know that is IP. I ... I feel like you I've been saying this a fair bit lately and I'll say it again. I I I **every generation deserves its own new myths**... to go, you know, shoulder-to-shoulder along with the other ones. It it there's there's a wonderful continuity to us telling stories uh with characters that were originally uh invented in the time of our grandparents, great-grandparents, some in some cases. It's it's great that there's a continuity of mythology, if you will, modern mythology with with superheroes and with uh you know, science fiction characters and whatnot.

That's great. I think there's it's a big it's a big world out there. It's a there's a lot of viewers and it seems like every generation should get to create their own as well. And it seems like that stuff's getting crowded out. The the **the original ideas are there's just not that much room for them anymore in the business ecosystem**. And that part makes me sad. 

INTERVIEWER: "So, but maybe the hope is if this show is as big a success as it certainly seemed last night that it may give other people bravery to do the same thing."

VINCE GILLIGAN: "I sure hope so. But from your mouth to God's ear, I hope so. Yeah."
