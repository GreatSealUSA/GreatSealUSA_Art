* "that there were now, furthermore, no less than six apexes, one above, one below, and four (so to say) to the four quarters. The sense of this, it seemed to me, might be that from above or below, or from any point of the compass, the creative Word might **be heard**, which is the great thesis of democracy. Democracy assumes that **anybody** from any quarter can speak, and speak truth, because **his mind** is not cut off from the truth. All **he** has to do is clear out his passions and then speak."

* "the anthropological works of the primitive initiation rites what is done to the young people in some primitive societies in order to test their courage, in order to integrate them in the social group. Now, most societies are **extremely dogmatic and fierce** in their integration of the individual. The individual is born as a separate entity. He is carved up, so to say, and made to fit into a pattern that the society requires. It doesn't require a total man; it requires *a part man* — not an individual, but a dividuum: someone **who has been divided up and put into a notch**." - Lecture I.1.1 - *The Celebration of Life*. March 1, 1967

* in the field of time:
    * "Now look at the right side of the dollar bill. Here’s the eagle, the bird of Zeus. The eagle is the downcoming of the god into the field of time."
    * "The initial **sound** (a Christian might say, the creative Word), out of which the whole world was precipitated, the big bang, the pouring of the transcendent energy into and expanding through the field of time. As soon as it enters the field of time, it breaks into pairs of opposites, the one becomes two. Now, when you have two, there are just three ways in which they can relate to one another: one way is of this one dominant over that; another way is of that one dominant over this; and **a third way is of the two in balanced accord. It is then, finally, out of these three manners of relationship that all things within the four quarters of space derive**. There is a verse in [Lao-tzu’s Tao-te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching) which states that out of the Tao, out of the transcendent, comes the One. Out of the One come Two; out of the Two come Three; and out of the Three come all things. So what I suddenly realized when I recognized that in the Great Seal of the United States there were"... - [Power of Myth book, year 1988, Page 35](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA35&dq=%22Three+come+all+things.+So+what+I+suddenly+realized+when+I+recognized+that+in+the+Great+Seal+of+the+United+States+there+were%22.&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)
    * "The hero’s sphere of action is not the transcendent but here, now, in the field of time, of good and evil — of the pairs of opposites. Whenever one moves out of the transcendent, one comes into a field of opposites. One has **eaten of the tree of knowledge**, not only of good and evil, but of male and female, of right and wrong, of this and that, and of light and dark."
    * "Heraclitus said that for God all things are good and right and just, but for man **some things are right and others are not. When you are a man, you are in the field of time and decisions**. One of the problems of life is to live with the realization of both terms, to say, “I know the center, and I know that good and evil are simply temporal aberrations and that, in God’s view, there is no difference.” BILL MOYERS: That is the **idea in the Upanishads**: “Not female, nor yet male is it, neither is it neuter. Whatever body it assumes, through that body it is served.” CAMPBELL: That is right. So Jesus says, “Judge not that you may not be judged.” That is to say, put yourself back in the position of Paradise before you thought in terms of good and evil. You don’t hear this much from the pulpits."
    * "the sacrifice of the physical desires and fears of the body to that which spiritually supports the body; is the body learning to know and express its own deepest life in the field of time? One way or another, we all have to find what best **fosters the flowering of our humanity in this contemporary life, and dedicate ourselves to that**."
    * "::: In the Near East, the god who descended into the field of time was originally a goddess. Jesus took over **what is really the Goddess’ role** in coming down in compassion. But when the Virgin acquiesces in being the vessel of the incarnation, she has herself already affected the redemption. It has become more and more apparent that the Virgin is equivalent in her suffering to the suffering of her son. In the Catholic Church now I think she is called the “co-savior.” :::"

"What's burning? The ego"    

* "known in Sanskrit as viveka, “discrimination.” There is a very important Buddha figure who is shown holding a **flaming sword** high over his head — and so what is that sword for? It is the sword of discrimination, separating the merely temporal from the eternal. It is the sword distinguishing that which is enduring from that which is merely passing. The tick-tick-tick of time shuts out eternity. We live in this field of time. But what is reflected in this field is an eternal principle made manifest."
* "Sit in a room and read — and read and read. And read the right books by the right people. Your mind is brought onto that level, and you have a nice, mild, **slow-burning rapture** all the time." - which ties heavily into the { book authoring, book touring, book writing, book publishing, book selling, book reading themes of PLUR1BUS Season One }
* "Finnegans Wake has to do with an event that occurred in Phoenix Park, which is a major park in Dublin. The phoenix is the bird that burns itself to death and then comes to life renewed. Phoenix Park thus becomes the Garden of Eden where the Fall took place, and where the cross was planted on the skull of Adam: O felix culpa (“O Phoenix culprit!” says Joyce). And so we have death and redemption."

Carol's stem cell metaphors of blank slate / stemming of other cells. A super-virgin lesbian marriage, dual virgins to men / semen / seamen pirates.

* "the Goddess begins coming back. There is actually an Upanishad from about the seventh century B.c.— which is just about the time she is coming back to force in the Aegean as well — where the Vedic gods are together, and they see a strange sort of amorphous thing down the way, a kind of smoky fog, and they ask, “What’s that?” None of them knows what it could be. So one of them suggests, “I’ll go find out what that is.” And he goes over to this smoky thing and says, **“I’m Agni, the Lord of Fire; I can burn anything**. Who are you?” And out of the fog there comes flying a piece of straw, which falls on the ground, and a voice says, “Let’s see you burn that.” Agni finds that he can’t ignite it. So he goes back to the other gods and says, “This surely is strange!” “Well, then,” says the Lord of Wind, “let me try.” So over he goes, and the same sort of thing takes place. “I’m Vayu, Lord of the Wind, I can blow anything around.” Again a straw is thrown. “Let’s see you blow that.” And he can’t. So he, too, returns. Then Indra, the greatest of the Vedic gods, approaches, but as he draws near, the apparition vanishes, and where it had been, a woman appears, a beautiful, mysterious woman, who instructs the gods, revealing to them the mystery of the ground of their own being. “That is the ultimate mystery of all being,” **she tells them, “from which you boys yourselves have received your powers.** And It can turn your powers off or on, as It wills.” The Indian name for that Being of all beings is **brahman (ब्रह्मन्), which is a neuter noun, neither male nor female**. And the Indian name for the woman is Maya-Shakti-Devi, “Goddess Giver of Life and Mother of Forms.” And there in that Upanishad **she appears as the teacher of the Vedic gods themselves** concerning the ultimate ground and source of their own powers and being. MOYERS: It’s the female wisdom. CAMPBELL: It’s the female as the giver of forms. She is the one who gave life to the forms and she knows where they came from. It is from that which is beyond male and female."

So there is a theme of Carol teaching the gods of the hive mind, a programmer hacking the hive mind with lessons and Finnegans Wake prankqueen - her fiction character Pirate Lady / her pen and her unpublished Bitter Pupa book.

* REMINDER CONTEXT: Minute 22 of co-pilot Episode One invokes James Joyce's Finnegans Wake book at the Zero Hour, countdown at "00:00:00:00"

* "The Prankquean (a transformation of Grace O'Malley) arrives at the castle of Jarl van Hoother (a figure representing the father/patriarch) three separate times.
"Schooling" the Men: Each time she visits, she asks the Jarl a riddle: "Why do I am alook alike a possum?" When he refuses to answer or engage, she kidnaps one of his sons—first the "Tristopher" and then the "Hilary" — and takes them back to her "wilderness" to educate or "school" them.
The Transformation: Under her care, the sons are altered. She "lathers" and "washes" them, effectively changing their rigid identities. For instance, the "sad" son becomes "sunny" and the "sunny" son becomes "sad."
The Resolution: By the third visit, the Jarl is forced to negotiate. The episode concludes with a "pact" (the creation of the first peace-treaty or "skool"), symbolizing the breaking of patriarchal stagnation through the female pirate's intervention." - Google Search summary 2026-01-08 night USA

* "In Finnegans Wake, James Joyce reimagines the Celtic pirate Gráinne Ní Mháille (anglicized as Grace O'Malley) as the Prankquean, a "pirate lady" who disrupts the patriarchal order of the castle-dwelling "Jarl van Hoother". Using a "portmanteau" of names such as "her grace o'malice" and "Annah the Allmaziful," Joyce crafts a legendary "schooling" where she kidnaps the Jarl’s twin sons to "wash" and re-educate them into their opposites, transforming the happy "Tristopher" into a sad "Tristian" and the sad "Hilary" into a happy "Luderman". This linguistic "piracy" mirrors the historical Gráinne’s defiance, forcing the rigid men of the castle into a "first peace" and symbolic renewal through her transformative, feminine power." - Google Search sumamry 2026-01-08 night USA

# Process is Agony

"And the process is agony. It has to be. Your being unmade. Your *self* is being incarcerated."    

* "JOSEPH CAMPBELL: **God is horrific**. Any god who can invent Hell is no candidate for the Salvation Army. The end of the world, think of it! But **there is a Muslim saying about the Angel of Death: “When the Angel of Death approaches, he is terrible. When he reaches you, it is bliss.”** In Buddhist systems, more especially those of Tibet, the meditation Buddhas appear in two aspects, one peaceful and the other wrathful. If you are clinging fiercely to your ego and its little temporal world of sorrows and joys, hanging on for dear life, it will be the wrathful aspect of the deity that appears. **It will seem terrifying**. But the moment your ego yields and gives up, that same meditation Buddha is experienced as a bestower of bliss. BILL MOYERS: Jesus did talk of bringing a sword, and I don’t believe he meant to use it against your fellow. He **meant it in terms of opening the ego — I come to cut you free from the binding ego** of your own self."
