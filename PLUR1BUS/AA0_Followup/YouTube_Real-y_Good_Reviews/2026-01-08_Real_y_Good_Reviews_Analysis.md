* "that there were now, furthermore, no less than six apexes, one above, one below, and four (so to say) to the four quarters. The sense of this, it seemed to me, might be that from above or below, or from any point of the compass, the creative Word might **be heard**, which is the great thesis of democracy. Democracy assumes that **anybody** from any quarter can speak, and speak truth, because **his mind** is not cut off from the truth. All **he** has to do is clear out his passions and then speak."

* "the anthropological works of the primitive initiation rites what is done to the young people in some primitive societies in order to test their courage, in order to integrate them in the social group. Now, most societies are **extremely dogmatic and fierce** in their integration of the individual. The individual is born as a separate entity. He is carved up, so to say, and made to fit into a pattern that the society requires. It doesn't require a total man; it requires *a part man* — not an individual, but a dividuum: someone **who has been divided up and put into a notch**." - Lecture I.1.1 - *The Celebration of Life*. March 1, 1967

* in the field of time:
    * "Now look at the right side of the dollar bill. Here’s the eagle, the bird of Zeus. The eagle is the downcoming of the god into the field of time."
    * "The initial **sound** (a Christian might say, the creative Word), out of which the whole world was precipitated, the big bang, the pouring of the transcendent energy into and expanding through the field of time. As soon as it enters the field of time, it breaks into pairs of opposites, the one becomes two. Now, when you have two, there are just three ways in which they can relate to one another: one way is of this one dominant over that; another way is of that one dominant over this; and **a third way is of the two in balanced accord. It is then, finally, out of these three manners of relationship that all things within the four quarters of space derive**. There is a verse in [Lao-tzu’s Tao-te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching) which states that out of the Tao, out of the transcendent, comes the One. Out of the One come Two; out of the Two come Three; and out of the Three come all things. So what I suddenly realized when I recognized that in the Great Seal of the United States there were"... - [Power of Myth book, year 1988, Page 35](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA35&dq=%22Three+come+all+things.+So+what+I+suddenly+realized+when+I+recognized+that+in+the+Great+Seal+of+the+United+States+there+were%22.&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)
    * "The hero’s sphere of action is not the transcendent but here, now, in the field of time, of good and evil — of the pairs of opposites. Whenever one moves out of the transcendent, one comes into a field of opposites. One has **eaten of the tree of knowledge**, not only of good and evil, but of male and female, of right and wrong, of this and that, and of light and dark."
    * "Heraclitus said that for God all things are good and right and just, but for man **some things are right and others are not. When you are a man, you are in the field of time and decisions**. One of the problems of life is to live with the realization of both terms, to say, “I know the center, and I know that good and evil are simply temporal aberrations and that, in God’s view, there is no difference.” BILL MOYERS: That is the **idea in the Upanishads**: “Not female, nor yet male is it, neither is it neuter. Whatever body it assumes, through that body it is served.” CAMPBELL: That is right. So Jesus says, “Judge not that you may not be judged.” That is to say, put yourself back in the position of Paradise before you thought in terms of good and evil. You don’t hear this much from the pulpits."
    * "the sacrifice of the physical desires and fears of the body to that which spiritually supports the body; is the body learning to know and express its own deepest life in the field of time? One way or another, we all have to find what best **fosters the flowering of our humanity in this contemporary life, and dedicate ourselves to that**."
    * "::: In the Near East, the god who descended into the field of time was originally a goddess. Jesus took over **what is really the Goddess’ role** in coming down in compassion. But when the Virgin acquiesces in being the vessel of the incarnation, she has herself already affected the redemption. It has become more and more apparent that the Virgin is equivalent in her suffering to the suffering of her son. In the Catholic Church now I think she is called the “co-savior.” :::"
