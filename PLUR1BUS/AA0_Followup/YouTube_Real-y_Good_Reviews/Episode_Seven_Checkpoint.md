Finn's Hotel 1923, Helen's Post-doctorate thesis assertion of James Joyce is the ultimate John 1:1 / Romans 11:32 depth-charge to the hive mind.

Getting pissed at Minute 22 on Walter White's Grave / Finnegan Funeral Wake.   

* "And how war yore maggies? Answer: They war loving, they love laughing, they laugh weeping, they weep smelling, they smell smiling, they smile hating, they hate" - page 142 https://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Page_142

  * "Gráinne O'Malley (Grace O'Malley)"

  * ToDo: title of a song by Little Sparta with Sally Timms and ASDA/Maharani, alluding to this complex, shifting meaning of "maggies" (possibly "maggots," "maidens," or "magic")

Finnegans Wake iterates, forever. Joyce's book has no begin or end. Alpha and Omega operating system. Page 581 of Joyce's Wake! Sorry I saw!

* OPERA_A Life on Kepler-22B? Album: *Hunky Dory* context.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft3b1-Cm-0M  "But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go (To Chritian Anti-Lesbian camp, freedom extermination camp),    
But her friend is no where to be seen.
Now she walks through her sunken dream (Sunken Pirate Ship Pirate Lady)
To the seats with the clearest view (Hugging Pirate Lady / circle in front of Carol's house view)
And she's hooked to the silver screen, (TV audience metaphors)
But the film is sadd'ning bore (Sad, Sad Carol bored)   
For she's lived it ten times or more. (Repeated the monomyth Page 581 Finnegans Wake *seen sorry* 10 times or mor)     
She could spit in the eyes of fools (Ship of fools, [We Built This City](https://youtu.be/K1b8AhIsSYQ?t=192))    
As they ask her to focus on" (Focus on the Hive Mind advantages)
