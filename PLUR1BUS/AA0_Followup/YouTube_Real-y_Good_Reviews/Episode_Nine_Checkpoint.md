"The Key". Minute 22 post-doc Helen's key. [Skeleton key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Skeleton_Key_to_Finnegans_Wake) to Finnegans Wake / Woke hive mind of Dublin and All / Pluribus We The People.    

"Everything, except the one thing..." [/r/OneThingIs](https://old.reddit.com/r/OneThingIs/) https://youtu.be/v3ph4WP4iQk?t=1053   

* "In that sense the wounded king, the maimed king of the Grail legend, is a counterpart of the Christ. He is there to evoke compassion and thus bring a dead wasteland to life. There is a mystical notion there of the spiritual function of suffering in this world. The one who suffers is, as it were, the Christ, come before us to **evoke the one thing that** turns the human beast of prey into a valid human being. That one thing is compassion. This is the theme that James Joyce takes over and develops in Ulysses" - Power Of Myth, 1988, George Lucas filmed lessons for science fiction fandoms.

    * Repeating "as it were, the Christ, come before us" - Episode One is "We Is Us", come before *Us* (alien birth of Jesus / Kepler 22 alien people), the Christ. With the ending of Season One Episode Nine on Christmas Eve Day. Christ-day. Also note that this one 1988 book also covers the Latin meaning of "Pluribus" meaning of trans-gender inclusion.

"Power of Myth" is by Joseph Campbell, not George Lucas. What are you talking about?

"REPEATING"... repeating what? What are you talking about?

Your "REMINDER" makes no logical or grammatical sense.

Try posting in complete sentences and explain your thought process. Alternately, if it's the case, please post in your first language and let YouTube translate it.Your entire post makes no sense.

"For you, how about "more ability to make your posts have some kind of logical flow through them, instead of these poorly-written fragmented pieces of nothing that make no sense. Again: please start taking your medication." 

I quoted a non-fiction book from Joseph Campbell *word for word* and they claim the writing isn't good enough. This is the words they claim aren't good enough: >>> "Power Of Myth" filmed by George Lucas for science fiction fandoms: "CAMPBELL: that electric thing that happens, and then the agony that can follow. The troubadours celebrate the agony of the love, the sickness the doctors cannot cure, the wounds that can be healed only by the weapon that delivered the wound. BILL MOYERS: Meaning? CAMPBELL: The wound is the wound of my passion and the agony of my love for this creature. The only one who can heal me is the one who delivered the blow." <<< for context of the message thread on YouTube. They won't discuss the Apple TV+ story and the 1988 book, they fixate on social media users in the cesspool of commenting social media.

## Can't Read Bill Moyers / Campbell

Just look at the context of what they reply to! A book quote turns people on the warpath against langauge.

"Why do you have so much trouble constructing a sentence with proper punctuation and grammar formation? No-one has any idea what you're talking about because you don't present a well-written and cogent paragraph."

* "When conformity enforcers overwhelm **diversity generators, all of us are in trouble**. Spartans --fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists -- can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "narrow-mindedness shown by \[even\] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments." Such **closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians** are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop.

I personally drew attention to this in public on this Reddit social media comment: https://old.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1ough2t/why_is_the_hive_mind_only_affected_by_carols/nobtdlf/

## Four Stars Missing

* "The Crest Distribution: There are nine stars arranged in an arc/cluster directly above the eagle's head."

* "The Side Distribution: There are four stars placed below that main cluster, typically seen on the eagle's right (dexter) side or nestled near the head/wings, totaling 13 stars in that central area."

* "Eagle's Right (Dexter) Side: The official seal used by President Trump in 2025 has the eagle facing its right (toward the olive branch)."

* "The "Pluribus" Side: The scroll usually curves so that "E Pluribus" is on the eagle's right (near the olive branch) and "Unum" is on the left (near the arrows)."

Four-Star Generals symbolism?    
Four stars, to the right of the eagle's head, are missing from the HDTV image In Pluribus. Not only is the Eagle's head and claws reversed, but only 9 stars out of 13 are under control of the Eagle. Why have the PLUR1BUS television show creators left out those 4 stars, what is the meaning? Doctored image / 78-second VLA message manipulation? Has the hive mind group-think removed those 4 stars because there is some intergalactic war hearts and minds going on with 13 outer-space systems and 4 out of 13 planetary star systems have already been conquered?

2025-12-28 afternoon USA quotes     
 
* "This design was used until 1945 when President Harry Truman authorized the redesign of the seal, flag, and coat of arms."

* "Two days after the order was issued, the flag was first publicly flown on October 27, 1945, when the U.S.S. Franklin D. Roosevelt was commissioned at Brooklyn Navy Yard; this flag was later given to the White House Historical Association by Mr. Elsey himself. The presidential flag remains the same today except for the addition of two stars to represent Alaska and Hawaii. President Dwight Eisenhower updated the seal in May 1959 with Executive Order 10823 and again with Executive Order 10860 in February 1960. These orders offered specific design details for the coat of arms that appear on the Presidential Seal and the Presidential Flag, and each added an additional star to represent the newly admitted states of Hawaii and Alaska."

https://youtu.be/Q86BVlLrx-Q?t=374 science fiction stories of 60 years ago. What about The { Torah, Bible, Quran } science fiction. The ending on Christmas Eve Day? December 24 / December 25 science fiction story about a planet Eden that sends a message to planet Earth - our planet, received through a burning bush by Moses? What about the download of orders and commandments, the 10 Commandments science fiction story of outer space aliens and space angels?

* "Moses received the Ten Commandments around 1446 BCE, shortly after the Israelites left Egypt, as part of the Sinai Covenant, though scholarly views vary, placing them anywhere from the 16th to 13th centuries BCE or even later"

The 1988 book Power of Myth on science fiction stories:    

BILL MOYERS: So many of the religions began with their own hero stories. The whole of the Orient has been blessed with the teaching of the good law brought back by Buddha, and the **Occident has been blessed by the laws Moses brought back from Sinai**. The tribal or local heroes perform their deeds for a single folk, and universal heroes like Mohammed, Jesus, and Buddha bring the message from afar. These heroes of religion came back with the wonder of God, not with a blueprint of God,

CAMPBELL: Well, you find an awful lot of laws in the Old Testament.

Which the Pluribus idea, in Latin, does not honor. Jesus / Moses are not mentioned in the Constitution of the United States of America / Deceleration of Independence writings (agreements). "Pluribus" Latin language is part of the Africa Nile river values of the Great Seal of the United States of America...

&nbsp;

https://youtu.be/Q86BVlLrx-Q?t=697 Arthur C. Clarke saw this coming in year 1953.

Oh, she skips nonfiction about science fiction. From a **June 1949** book. She stops at year 1953 going back.

* "Bodhisattva is a large one; and the departure from the world is regarded not as a fault, but as the first step into that noble path at the remotest turn of which illumination is to be won concerning the deep emptiness of the universal round. Such an ideal is well known, also, to Hinduism: the one freed in life (jīvan mukta), **desireless**, compassionate, and wise, “with the heart concentrated by yoga, viewing **all things with equal regard, beholds himself in all beings and all beings in himself**. In whatever way he leads his life, that one lives in God.” The story is told of a Confucian scholar who besought the twenty-eighth Buddhist patriarch, Bodhidharma, “**to pacify** his soul.” Bodhidharma retorted, “Produce it and I will pacify it.” The Confucian replied, “That is my trouble, I cannot find it.” Bodhidharma said, “Your wish is granted.” The Confucian understood and departed in peace." - [Page 142, book published in June 1949](https://books.google.com/books?id=I1uFuXlvFgMC&pg=PA142&dq=%22Bodhisattva+is+a+large+one;+and+the+departure+from+the+world+is+regarded+not+as+a+fault,+but+as+the+first+step+into+that+noble+path%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X). ... "On June 26th, 1949 The New York Times published a review of Hero which consisted of mostly snide remarks" - [NYE 2023 commentary](https://www.jcf.org/post/the-hero-with-a-thousand-faces-a-modern-marvel)

* Carol wants to birth a child: "the creative and redemptive roles of the female power, first **on a cosmic scale as the Mother of the Universe**, then again on the human plane as the Mother of the Hero."; "The cosmogonie cycle is presented with astonishing consistency in the sacred writings of all the continents"

* "with her web can control the movements of the Sun. The hero who has come under the protection of the Cosmic Mother cannot be harmed. The thread of Ariadne brought Theseus safely through the adventure of the labyrinth. This is the guiding power that runs through the work of Dante in the female figures of Beatrice and the Virgin, and appears in Goethe’s Faust successively as Gretchen, Helen of Troy, and the Virgin. “Thou art the living fount of hope,” prays Dante, at the end of his safe passage through the perils of the Three Worlds; “Lady, thou art so great and so availest, that whoso would have grace, and has not recourse to thee, would have his desire fly without wings. Thy benignity not only succors him who asks, but oftentimes freely foreruns the asking. In thee mercy, in thee pity, in thee magnificence, **in thee whatever of goodness is in any creature, are united**." - Again, United, USA, Pluribus meaning.



Repeating: "all things with equal regard, beholds himself in all beings and all beings in himself" - that's the meaning of the Apple TV+ show title, "Pluribus". To pacify. 

&nbsp;

https://youtu.be/Q86BVlLrx-Q?t=777 ("lucky number" 777 seconds, like 13 is lucky!) "Earth is just a relay station" - hence why I point out Minute 37 of Episode Two is missing 4 stars (already relayed?), the hive mind has manipulated the POTUS Seal ... which is the year 1776 origins of the Latin phrase "Pluribus". Why are so many Breaking Bad / Better Call Saul fandoms afraid to discuss year 1776 and stop at 1953 science fiction and not real-world USA multi-generation blueprint of symbolism in the POTUS seal / Great Seal of USA?

https://youtu.be/Q86BVlLrx-Q?t=936 The signal converts US (We) to peaceful workers. Well, is Walter White and Saul Goodman and Kim Wexler the kind of hard-working USA Dollar Bill chasing "Pluribus" (on currency) world of founding fathers we need? Poisoning the legal system with Saul his and her law practice? Science teachers like Walter White who fuck over children's parents with meth? I think the YouTube video is overlooking the "Water of Life" scene of the hive mind. **"Very similar to the Latin aqua vitae"** - which rocket fuel can be made from booze.

* Fiction learning... "in October Sky (both book and film), the boys use alcohol (moonshine) from a local bootlegger as a key liquid binder/stabilizer for their homemade rocket fuel"

https://youtu.be/Q86BVlLrx-Q?t=956 "Galactic Tumbleweed Theory"

https://youtu.be/Q86BVlLrx-Q?t=1006 "Is the signal a gift or a weapon". Yha, well is COVID-2019 pandemic a gift or weapon from nature? Is alcohol a gift or weapon for pirate ships? Is measles a gift or a weapon, coming out of Earth with spread programming / viral programming?   

https://youtu.be/Q86BVlLrx-Q?t=1170 "It is love all the way down", [Interstellar year 2014 film](Interstellar_2014). "November 13, 2014 — In a way that neither the passage of time, nor gravity, nor data can achieve, **love is the key to evolution**. Love lifts us up" - https://reactormag.com/love-in-sci-fi-interstellar-speech/ "Love isn’t something we invented. It’s observable, powerful, it has to mean something… Love is the one thing we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space."

https://youtu.be/Q86BVlLrx-Q?t=1313 "What happens when you broadcast a paradox into a hive mind" - yha, that's the core theme of the numbers 1132 in James Joyce's entire body of work. 

* "There was that same number again, 1132, right out of the Good Book! **Joyce had taken that paradox of the Christian faith** as the motto of the greatest masterwork of his life. And there he describes ruthlessly the depths of the private and public **monstrosities of human life and action** in the utterly sinful course of human history. It’s all there — **told with love**." - [*Power of Myth* book year 1988, page 145](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA145&dq=%22Can+Westerners+grasp+the+mystical+experience+that+leaves+theology+behind?%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X), Skywalker Ranch California for science fiction fandoms
