"The Key". Minute 22 post-doc Helen's key. [Skeleton key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Skeleton_Key_to_Finnegans_Wake) to Finnegans Wake / Woke hive mind of Dublin and All / Pluribus We The People.    

"Everything, except the one thing..." [/r/OneThingIs](https://old.reddit.com/r/OneThingIs/) https://youtu.be/v3ph4WP4iQk?t=1053   

* "In that sense the wounded king, the maimed king of the Grail legend, is a counterpart of the Christ. He is there to evoke compassion and thus bring a dead wasteland to life. There is a mystical notion there of the spiritual function of suffering in this world. The one who suffers is, as it were, the Christ, come before us to **evoke the one thing that** turns the human beast of prey into a valid human being. That one thing is compassion. This is the theme that James Joyce takes over and develops in Ulysses" - Power Of Myth, 1988, George Lucas filmed lessons for science fiction fandoms.

    * Repeating "as it were, the Christ, come before us" - Episode One is "We Is Us", come before *Us* (alien birth of Jesus / Kepler 22 alien people), the Christ. With the ending of Season One Episode Nine on Christmas Eve Day. Christ-day. Also note that this one 1988 book also covers the Latin meaning of "Pluribus" meaning of trans-gender inclusion.

"Yeah, yeah, Campbell, Power of Myth, Hero's Journey, etc etc. This is basic story-writing stuff and has been for decades. So what? The Lucas name-drop is meaningless here and is a failed attempt at some kind of "flex"."

"Power of Myth" is by Joseph Campbell, not George Lucas. What are you talking about?

"REPEATING"... repeating what? What are you talking about?

Your "REMINDER" makes no logical or grammatical sense.

Try posting in complete sentences and explain your thought process. Alternately, if it's the case, please post in your first language and let YouTube translate it.Your entire post makes no sense.
