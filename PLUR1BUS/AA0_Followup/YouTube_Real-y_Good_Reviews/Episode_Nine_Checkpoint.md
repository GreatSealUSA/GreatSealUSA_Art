* "In that sense the wounded king, the maimed king of the Grail legend, is a counterpart of the Christ. He is there to evoke compassion and thus bring a dead wasteland to life. There is a mystical notion there of the spiritual function of suffering in this world. The one who suffers is, as it were, the Christ, come before us to **evoke the one thing that** turns the human beast of prey into a valid human being. That one thing is compassion. This is the theme that James Joyce takes over and develops in Ulysses" - Power Of Myth, 1988, George Lucas filmed lessons for science fiction fandoms.

    * Repeating "as it were, the Christ, come before us" - Episode One is "We Is Us", before *Us*, the Christ. With the ending of Season One Episode Nine on Christmas Eve Day. Christ-day. Also note that this one 1988 book also covers the Latin meaning of "Pluribus" meaning of trans-gender inclusion.
