2. Joseph Campbell on marriage / falling / love https://capacity-building.com/excerpts/reflections-on-the-art-of-living-a-joseph-campbell-companion/

   * “And the two kinetic movements that block this harmonious rhythm are exactly the two temptations of the Buddha: desire, which draws you to possess the object, and loathing or fear, which turns you away from it. When you move to possess or to turn away from an object, you are reacting to the world of delusory appeals and terrors that Maya has projected.”
   * “If you’re concerned with prospering or failing with the object, eating or not eating it, your perspective involves desire and loathing, the temptations of the Buddha, and the projecting power of Maya.”
   * “It is your mental attitude that determines whether you experience the projecting or the revealing power. **The world is there in both modes**. It is not that the world changes, it’s your consciousness."
   * “Successful marriage is leading innovative lives together, being open, **non-programmed.  It is a free fall**: how you handle each new thing as it comes along.  As a drop of oil on the ocean, you must float, using intellect and compassion to ride the waves.” (Pirate Lady riding waves together metaphors)
   * “When you **rescue someone from drowning**, you never know if they’ll pull you down with them.” (the drunk bomb house bomb night that they were last together in Carol's house)
   * “Survival is the second law of life.  The first is that we are all one.” (Pluribus USA Founding Fathers realization of encounter with native Americans and step 13)
   * “One rendition is the Sacred Marriage, the meeting with the beloved which brings the birth of your own spiritual life, with the bride being whatever the life is that you’re relating to: male/female, I/Thou, this/that.” (We / Us / "We is Us" pilot episode, trans-gender Pirate Man / Lady, Chapter One of the new book trans-gender authoring)

3. “I have really found when I look around that the romantic love I see is **this ideal, the anima**. The anima is the ideal that you carry within yourself that you put onto the different entities out there and you unite with that. **Pretty soon you see through the projection**. And then what happens?” https://tttt.transistor.fm/episodes/just-one-thing-joseph-campbell
