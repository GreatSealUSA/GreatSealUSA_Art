2. Joseph Campbell on marriage / falling / love https://capacity-building.com/excerpts/reflections-on-the-art-of-living-a-joseph-campbell-companion/

   * “And the two kinetic movements that block this harmonious rhythm are exactly the two temptations of the Buddha: desire, which draws you to possess the object, and loathing or fear, which turns you away from it. When you move to possess or to turn away from an object, you are reacting to the world of delusory appeals and terrors that Maya has projected.”
   * “If you’re concerned with prospering or failing with the object, eating or not eating it, your perspective involves desire and loathing, the temptations of the Buddha, and the projecting power of Maya.”
   * “It is your mental attitude that determines whether you experience the projecting or the revealing power. **The world is there in both modes**. It is not that the world changes, it’s your consciousness."
   * “Successful marriage is leading innovative lives together, being open, **non-programmed.  It is a free fall**: how you handle each new thing as it comes along.  As a drop of oil on the ocean, you must float, using intellect and compassion to ride the waves.” (Pirate Lady riding waves together metaphors)
   * “When you **rescue someone from drowning**, you never know if they’ll pull you down with them.” (the drunk bomb house bomb night that they were last together in Carol's house)
   * “Survival is the second law of life.  The first is that we are all one.” (Pluribus USA Founding Fathers realization of encounter with native Americans and step 13)
   * “One rendition is the Sacred Marriage, the meeting with the beloved which brings the birth of your own spiritual life, with the bride being whatever the life is that you’re relating to: male/female, I/Thou, this/that.” (We / Us / "We is Us" pilot episode, trans-gender Pirate Man / Lady, Chapter One of the new book trans-gender authoring)

3. “I have really found when I look around that the romantic love I see is **this ideal, the anima**. The anima is the ideal that you carry within yourself that you put onto the different entities **out there and you unite** with that. **Pretty soon you see through the projection**. And then what happens?” https://tttt.transistor.fm/episodes/just-one-thing-joseph-campbell (And We Unite, Pluribus, with that)

"I don't think Carol knows. I don't think *We* are supposed to know, either" 

* "You have to break past your image of God to get through to the connoted illumination. The psychologist Jung has a relevant saying: “Religion is a defense against the experience of God.” The mystery has been reduced to a set of concepts and ideas, and emphasizing these concepts and ideas can short-circuit the transcendent, connoted experience. An **intense experience of mystery is what one has to regard as the ultimate religious** [experience](/Experience_Pluribus_Project)." - Skywalker Ranch lessons for Star Wars / Science Fiction fandoms. Published year 1988.

* "The inner world is the world of your requirements and your energies and your structure and your possibilities that meets the outer world. And the outer world is the field of your incarnation. That’s where you are. You’ve got to keep both going. As Novalis said, “The seat of the soul is there where the inner and outer worlds meet.” " - Skywalker Ranch lessons for Star Wars science fiction audiences, published year 1988

*  Sanskrit phrase Tat Tvam Asi ("Thou Art That"), emphasizing that the divine is not an external entity but the "inner" reality of every individual.  "When the inner eye is awakened and a revelation arises from inner space to meet impressions brought by the sense from outer space to the mind, the significance of the conjunction is lost unless the outward image opens to receive and embody the elementary idea" - The Inner Reaches of Outer Space, page 8
