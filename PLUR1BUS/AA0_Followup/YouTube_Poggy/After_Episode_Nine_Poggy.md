It is real, the reality of how humans behave to each other. Pirate Lady jumped out of the pages of a fiction book Carol authored. People fall in love with fiction characters all the time. That's the point the story is making. Christmas day, turn to Bible verse "1  John 4:20" - have you seen Pirate Lady? Have you seen God? Have you seen Buddha walking down the street?

"If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him"   

This is a similar lesson to Bible verse "1 John 4:20" from the Levant 2000 years ago.

Carol is seeing Pirate Lady...
