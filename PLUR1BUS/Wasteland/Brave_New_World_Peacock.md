# Brave New World Peacock

Is Vegas of episode 3, with Carol giving the finger out the car window to the truck... (is that episode 3, seen in a preview)

Is Vegas going to be "savage lands", and people even being given some technical means to escape "The Matrix" so Zion / Vegas?

Just guessing / wild as guessing here.
