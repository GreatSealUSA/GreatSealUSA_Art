# Sarcasm Poisoing Irony

&nbsp;

> When the Hive was like "we thought you were being sarcastic, but we weren't sure". They literally have millions upon millions of examples of sarcasm, and they can't extrapolate those examples to infer for the future, one of the most basic signs of personhood.

I think this topic runs way deeper into the show.

Vince Gilligan made a public protest to society back in February 2025.... think of the time frame - before Pluribus was known to people: https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/breaking-bad-creator-vince-gilligan-good-guys-walter-white-1236309604/

Too many people view Walter White and Saul Goodman as a bad-ass role model. Rich white men who do not follow the law.  People treat these leaders as god in society. And the audience treats it as cool, is not horrified.

If you study David Foster Wallace, and even the comedy TV series "Lat Man On Earth" about a virus outbreak.... we are in a post-sarcasm post-irony world. People satire-wash and "milk the LOL cow" of serious problems. Wrapping serious matters of USA health care and other real-world crisis into jokes and memes is a method of society control. Infinite Satire / Infinite Jest is fully realized USA society. 

Note how Carol mocks her own book readers. And her unpublished book title could mean (among other meanings): "Bitter coming out of the closet",  the hostility of society to her marriage. And how *Pirate Lady* was concealed from her book authors, the choices she has made to pander to a cruel society. One could even compare her to Harry Potter author in terms of treating her fans as tools while harboring disdain towards humanity.

Carol is very sarcastic and cynical towards her fandom / customers / society in general.

If you have never the 1940's film by Charlie Chaplin, The Great Dictator. It comes to mind in better-written words than my own:

&nbsp;

"I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness."

I also point to Finnegans Wake at 23 minutes into episode 1 of Pluribus. James Joyce tries to drown the religions of the world in sarcasm / irony / Tower of Babel language conflicts. That's a big topic....
