haha. Why would ANYONE think "The Internet" has an intention? Funded by Edward Bernays students of advertising, marketing, owned by the richest people in the world (Starlink Musk ISP).

That's like saying bookstores have an intention.

There is no "clergy" and "morality" teachers for Internet. There used to be hive mind rules. People used to call themselves "Netizens", and Reddit had a concept of "Reddit etiquette" that largely was abandoned in year 2014 onward (became toxic instead under IRA invasion of Reddit). "Downvote disagree" is now common on Reddit. People used to call it out and try and stop it before in 2014.

Now the government steps in like they do for telephone networks: bomb threats, school shootings, crime, etc.

The chance to have a clergy / spiritual teachers of the Internet really didn't take off. Timothy Leary is an example that tried: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberdelic
