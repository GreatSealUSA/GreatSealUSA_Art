# Predict Fragmented

As of the ed of episode 3, the Reddit / Bluesky / YouTube / Review communities seem convinced it is theentireworld unified vs. 13.

With 4 seasons of show planned... I think the Earth fragmentation may appear.

1. Left vs. Right metaphors

2. Conservative vs. Liberal metaphors

3. Religion vs. Religion

4. Language vs. Language. Carol seeking English only and then engaging with a Spanish already points this direction.

5. USA as source of the militry virus release, New Mexico as source of atomic bomb.

6. East vs. West

7. Gender. Pirate Lady gender change. Carol and Helen marriage. this is a global issue, Russia, Pakistan and Iran, not just USA gender conflicts.

The metaphors of hardware RNA change vs. software partittions / virtual machines.
