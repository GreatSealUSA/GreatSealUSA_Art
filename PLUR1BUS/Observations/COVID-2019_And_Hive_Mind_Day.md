# COVID-2019 And Hive Mind Day

Virus events that impacted the entire world: COVID-19 (reality of Earth) and Hive Mind Day (fiction Pluribus story).

Topic: The clergy, religion rituals, one planet, one Pale Blue Dot experience

Apparently, based on the first two episodes, Carol can ask for a get-together party (more than a video call or a phone conference call), and the group can ask for Air Force One and an entertainment trip to Vegas.

The mention of Helen's funeral has been in the story, but as the bodies are collected - maybe at least for the 12 free thinkers, a memorial service and ritual for all of humanity. The nearly one billion who died.

But the hive mind says they seek positive. A funeral ritual / a funeral wake is positive.

In the real world, I have seen this massive oversight in socieety. The clergy did not organize ritual for grief. A global day or days of celebrating those who died and have returned to the eart. The hive mind / group grief that COVID-19 caused. The fact that a virus, millions of years of biological technology, went around the world from airport to airport, person to person, peer topeer and touched all our lives. 

COVID-19 was a far more global event than Septembr 11, 2001 - in touching lives. Why have the clergy of all religions not made a call for all religions of the world to come together to the unprocessed grief?
