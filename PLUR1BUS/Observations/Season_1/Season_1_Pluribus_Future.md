the potential of this show...    
I think the most important thing for humanity is

1. Joseph Campbell's 1987 Book Inner Reaches, 1988 book Power of Myth. The Great Seal USA teachings. How it relates to power and greed.

2. Hate and war are not valid choices. Evil is not a valid choice to pick from as a career / profession / profit plan.

I think an idea that is appealing is that the hive mind din't create the rules from Kepler programming. The choice to share sleeping, not kill living things, end war... being a choice that humanity made once problems were understood to be common.

Not some alien values that were forced from outer space, but a connection that brought in a new form of thinking that we already had - and were not listening to each other.
