# Film and TV audience hive minds

Hive minds for power / social power popularity   
Hive minds for profit / wealth of an intellectual property asset 

The in-show hive mind ships a woman from across the world to seduce Carol and keep her engaged. Active measures of the salespeople, military strategists, intelligence agencies skills of the human world to pacify Carol.

Casting directors / scheming what will be popular with the audience. When making a film or television show.

Actual human beings are performing / acting / practicing sexual activity and staging romance scenes together. Dressing up, cosmetics, clothing / wardrobe. For the sake of exploiting the current taaste of a Apple iPhone / iPad media consumer.

This is an arranged sex act. Arranged touching. the people involved say they are happy and how much better this life is working for the society hive mind.

The mechanical bride. The mechanics of the screenplay and the cast support systems, the travel agents for the actors, the meetings and editing and tweaking to satisfy the lusting touch-device iPhone users who purchase the show on Apple TV+ for iPad intimacy. The preferences of catering food and hotels and "dating" to keep cast members engaged in their "profession" and emotional presentations for maximum emotional exploitation of audiences to hate and rage and seduction. The editing to match heartbeats of the audience, the timing, the shaving of a few frames or seconds of slow reality creeping into the clock jumping Pluribus on-screen timers.

It isn't just a fiction Pirate Lady puppet who isn't self aware they are a puppet. Even though they KNOW they are a hive mind puppet, even if the actor / actress competes in a contest, the outcome is the same.

Humans that would never encounter each other are touching each other for the motives of profit and fame. An arranged marriage, an arranged date, a socially arranged intimacy and pairing. Even in interviews, on stage, photographed together, seated with each other. All because that's power over audience. 

ToDo: read these. Haven't even read them, just tossing them here for follow up

“Man becomes, as it were, the sex organs of the machine world, as the bee of the plant world, enabling it to fecundate and to evolve ever new forms. The machine world reciprocates man’s love by expediting his wishes and desires, namely, in providing him with wealth”
― Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man

# Media ecology itself, streaming staging

When you bring Finnegans Wake into a book author book tour story about book media

The show itself becomes the media ecology topic.

"Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966

"I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do," vowing not to serve it and embracing "silence, exile, and cunning"

My concern is the Putin Internet Research Agency hive mind to be pro-disease RFK Jr pro-measles December 24, 2018 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192

That's my attraction to Pluribus Great Seal USA hive mind concerns. A hive mind that values authentic learning and analysis of media to recognize the harm in poisoning education as Russia has against children to have parents cheer on diseases as "winning" over education and science. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192
