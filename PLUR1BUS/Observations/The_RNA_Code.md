# The RNA Code

my first impression is how it is identified as morse code, or like 4 messages of morse code. Still primitive. 78 seconds of 4 channels of morse code is not much information!

I've yet to see people remark on this. Unlike a zombie virus, it does not wreck the brain and remove human intelligence. I say this, because a short message could poison or wreck the brain.

I've yet to see people remark on this: that the human brain needed very little to bring people together. That the amount of hardware / RNA change to the human mind was small to bring world peace while still being able to do all the learned / aquired expeirence and knowledge.

How close humanity already was to utopia. How little genetic code was requried as a "hotfix".
