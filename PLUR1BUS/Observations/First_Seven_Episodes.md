Justin Clark: "I reviewed the first seven episodes of Pluribus."    
Notable that there are 9 episodes planned for this season, so does not cover *everything* in first season. Two seasons were also approved from the very start, so the who was written without anxiety of cancelation after first season.

## Plot leak

"The bulk of the series focuses on a historical romance author named Carol (Rhea Seehorn), who was angry, bitter, and disgusted with humanity way before people got shiny and happy. When the cosmic event completely upends Carol’s staid, anhedonic existence, she finds herself the last living soul on Earth longing for a return to the status quo."

This sentence implies *the series*, beyond first two episodes at the time of this GitHub commit. It implies that out of the 12 free thinkers, she is the only one who wants to defend against the RNA change to humanity.

"Pluribus isn’t shy about showing us just how much Carol is almost religiously devoted to being an asshole, in ways that are occasionally hard to watch. There’s a very easy read of the series in which Carol represents Americans who would rather set the planet on fire than share what they have with anyone else, but it goes much deeper and weirder, exploring the tug of war between imperfect socialism and pure nihilism."

"This is a series about what happens when human empathy is stretched to its limit.
Pluribus seems to suggest that progress that moves too fast will ultimately break things"

I mean clearly war is broken, military is broken, travel rules are broken. A woman jumps on an airplane from Tunisia to USA without any regulations / red tape. This has huge implications for people being able to come together who were previously blocked by nations in conflict. Also note that the 5 English speakers who meet have family go with them, so there is still a sense of in-person companionship from hive mind members.
