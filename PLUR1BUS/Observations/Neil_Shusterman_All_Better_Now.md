"Neal Shusterman's latest novel, All Better Now, is a dystopian thriller about a contagious virus called Crown Royale that causes complete contentment in those who recover, while posing a deadly risk to about one in 25 people. The story follows characters grappling with the societal and ethical dilemmas of this pandemic, as some groups try to eradicate the virus and others believe it should spread to create a more benevolent world." - Google search A.I. 2025-11-08
