# Carol the DUI Drunk Author

Assertions

1. Minute 22 of Episode One, at the Zero Hour "00:00:00:00" countdown. Carol is boozing at a Public House.

2. Helen tells Carol about Jame Joyce's Finnegans Wake book. Graduate school experience with 1923 book "Finn's Hotel".

3. Helen falls backwards on her head and dies like Tim Finnegan does, a cracked skull. Look at the eyes of Helen dark from internal bleeding.

4. Carol is a book author who drinks heavily. James Joyce was a book author who drank heavily in Paris.

Ok, that's keeping it short and simple.

Carol drinks, drinks more, and plays with weapon systems while drunk and blows up her house. Boozing, drunk, DUI device on her automobile.

So what am I saying? One quote to rule them all.

# Sober books

* "**Sober**, modern Occidental judgement is founded on a total misunderstanding of the realities depicted in the fairy tale, **the myth, and the divine comedies of redemption**"

Earwicker Public House, Helen trust Carol into *Finnegans Wake* drunk shoved... while Helen fell back and hit her head on the concrete and *died* like Tim Finnegan. Except Helen keeps communicating messages from the afterlife.

That's the perspective of this Git Hub take on PLUR1BUS Apple TV+ show about a drunk author as part of 13 against the cosmic invasion.

Oh yha, Annie's last name in Joyce's book, ALP, sounds a lot like "Pluribus" title of the show. And Finnegans Wake is mind-blowing about sound-alike word choices.
