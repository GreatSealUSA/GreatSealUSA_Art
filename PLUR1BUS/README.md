# Carol the DUI Drunk Author

Assertions

1. Minute 22 of Episode One, at the Zero Hour "00:00:00:00" countdown. Carol is boozing at a Public House.

2. Helen tells Carol about Jame Joyce's Finnegans Wake book. Graduate school experience with year 1923 book "Finn's Hotel".

3. Helen falls backwards on her head and dies like Tim Finnegan does, a cracked skull. Look at the eyes of Helen dark from internal bleeding.

4. Carol is a book author who drinks heavily. James Joyce was a book author who drank heavily in Paris.

Ok, that's keeping it short and simple.

Carol drinks, drinks more, and plays with weapon systems while drunk and blows up her house. Boozing, drunk, DUI device on her automobile.

So what am I saying? One quote to rule them all.

# Sober books

* "**Sober**, modern Occidental judgement is founded on a total misunderstanding of the realities depicted in the fairy tale, **the myth, and the divine comedies of redemption**" - [June 1949 book, chapter 2](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell#The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces_\(1949\))

* "Why attempt to make plausible, or even interesting, to men and women consumed with passion, the experience of transcendental bliss? As dreams that were momentous by night **may seem simply silly in the light of day**, so the poet and the prophet can discover themselves playing the idiot **before a jury of sober eyes**. The easy thing is to commit the **whole community**" - [June 1949 book, page 189](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces/I1uFuXlvFgMC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22playing+the+idiot+before+a+jury+of+sober+eyes.+The+easy+thing+is+to+commit+the+whole+community%22&pg=PA189&printsec=frontcover).

Earwicker Public House, Helen thrust Carol into *Finnegans Wake* drunk *86'ing* shoved Carol... and the opposite reaction to dropping *that book* in a Public House... Helen [fell back and hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42tj0hQuaFY) her head on the concrete and *died* like Tim Finnegan and his ladder. Except Helen keeps communicating messages and memories from the afterlife... so is she "really Dead", like Tim?

That's the perspective of this Git Hub take on PLUR1BUS Apple TV+ show about a drunk author as part of 13 against the cosmic hearts and minds invasion.

Oh yha, Annie's last name in Joyce's book, ALP, sounds a lot like "Pluribus" title of the show. And Finnegans Wake *is mind-blowing about sound-alike word* choices.

# PLUR1BUS Season One *Attitude*

* “Apocalypse does not point to a fiery Armageddon but to the fact that **our ignorance and our complacency are coming to an end**… The exclusivism of there being only one way in which we can be saved, the idea that there is a single religious group that is in sole possession of the truth — that is the world as we know it that must pass away. What is the kingdom? It lies in **our realization of the ubiquity of the divine presence** in our neighbors, in our enemies, in **all of us**.” ― Joseph Campbell, *Thou Art That*: Transforming Religious Metaphor

# More, Yha

* "The difficult point is made vivid in an anecdote from Yorubaland (West Africa), which is told of the trickster-divinity Edshu. One day, this odd god came walking along a path between two fields. “He beheld in either field a farmer at work and proposed to play the two a turn. He donned a hat that was on the one side red but on the other white, green before and black behind \[these being the colors of the four World Directions: i.e., Edshu was a personification of the Center, the axis mundi, or the World Navel\]; so that when the two friendly farmers had gone home to their village and the one had said to the other, ‘Did you see that old fellow go by today in the white hat?’ the other replied, ‘Why, the hat was red.’ To which the first retorted, ‘It was not; it was white.’ ‘But it was red,’ insisted the friend, ? saw it with my own two eyes.’ ‘Well, you must be blind,’ declared the first. **‘You must be drunk,’ rejoined the other**. And so the argument developed and the two came to blows. When they began to knife each other, they were brought by neighbors before the headman for judgment. Edshu was among the crowd at the trial, and when the headman sat **at a loss to know where justice lay**, the old trickster revealed himself, made known his prank, and showed the hat. ‘The two could not help but quarrel,’ he said. ? wanted it that way. Spreading strife is my greatest joy.’ “ - [June 1949 book. Page 37.](https://books.google.com/books?id=I1uFuXlvFgMC&pg=PA37&dq=%22they+were+brought+by+neighbors+before+the+headman+for+judgment.+Edshu+was+among+the+crowd+at+the+trial,+and+when+the+headman%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

* "::: Or, as James Joyce has phrased it: “equals of opposites, evolved by a onesame power of nature or of spirit, as the sole condition and means of its himundher manifestation and polarised for reunion by the symphysis of their antipathies” (Finnegans Wake, p. 92) :::" - [June 1949 book, page 89](https://books.google.com/books?id=I1uFuXlvFgMC&pg=PA89&dq=%22Or,+as+James+Joyce+has+phrased+it:+equals+of+opposites%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X). ... "according to the antique manner of symbolization, the **one goddess in two aspects**; and their confrontation epitomizes the whole sense of the difficult road of trials."

&nbsp;

Minute 22... Rejoyce the book that Helen introduced at the Zero Hour countdown in a Public House. For Christmas Eve Day ending of Season One of the Pluribus TV show. One goddess, a unity Helen and Carol marriage, in two aspects.

"When man is in the service of society, you have a monster state, and that’s what is threatening the world at this minute." - year 1987
