# American Pie π

π Eye above the Great Seal USA pyramid      

π Sees Pale Blue Dot Pride    

π Sees World Wide Web of Goodness     

π Sees Indra's Net of Gems that sparkle to the π eye    

&nbsp;

Indra's net of sparkle jewels of anywhere any goodness. See past *the superficial satire and sarcasm* to the 13th Black Friday floor: "And I'll be there, to shine in your Japan, to sparkle in your China. Yes, I'll be there, Bodhisattva?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyABbwsYQCA
