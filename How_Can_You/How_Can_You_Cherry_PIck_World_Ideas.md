# American Pie π

π Eye above the Great Seal USA pyramid      

π Sees Pale Blue Dot Pride    

π Sees World Wide Web of Goodness     

π Sees Indra's Net of Gems that sparkle to the π eye    

&nbsp;

Indra's net of sparkle jewels of anywhere any goodness. See past *the superficial satire and sarcasm* to the 13th Black Friday floor: "And I'll be there, to shine in your Japan, to sparkle in your China. Yes, I'll be there, Bodhisattva?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyABbwsYQCA

* "what’s might be being masked is economic interest. I mean this insight has belonged to our culture too. I think many of you will be familiar with the Joe Hills song “You’ll get pie in the sky when you die”, and there is a certain style of American religion; I call it the Billy Graham style. I don’t dislike Billy, but it is notable that Billy Graham, you know, plays golf with the Pharaoh. I mean that’s not like Moses leading his people out of bondage, I mean, Moses didn’t play golf with the Pharaoh and pray over the Pharaoh’s troops. It’s just a confusing thing when you see that… it’s not like the story exactly. Hard to imagine Billy Graham being crucified, although I have suggested it on occasion, ah… people don’t seem to listen. I try… I try…"
* … "I am not saying there aren’t any religious figures that are significant in the 20th Century; there are magnificent ones like Ghandi, Martin Luther King, they appear as rare exceptions… rare exceptions. I mean, there people who still try to lead their people out of bondage; not everybody plays golf with the Pharaoh, but the suspicion hangs on the entire religious enterprise that it serves vested interests: economic interests."
