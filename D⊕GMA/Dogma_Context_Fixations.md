"Everything is: Dogmas, Mass Media fandom Dogma, Caetextia"      

Fixated on Dogma:

1. ONE and ONLY ONE true perfect science fiction story. The Bible.

2. 9/11, [September 11](https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2007/03/06/l-esprit-du-terrorisme-par-jean-baudrillard_879920_3382.html), ONE AND ONLY ONE PERFECT BOOK story, The Holy Quran, the year 635 story. The Mecca geography.

3. ONE AND ONLY ONE PERFECT SCIENCE FICTION BOOK: Book of Mormon. Translated by Joseph Smith from golden plates and published in year 1830.

4. ONE AND ONLY ONE PERFECT BOOK: Scientology. L. Ron Hubbard. Year 1950 bestseller, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health.

5. [Cherry Picking of the entire Public Library](/How_Can_You/How_Can_You_Cherry_PIck_World_Ideas.md), Library of Alexandria, Library of Congress

&nbsp;

One-story media venues, only one book: { Church, Mosque, Synagogue, Temple }. Competitive storytelling clergy, competitive venues for media storytelling, competing channels that wage war with one another over which one perfect book. Book supremacy, book dogma. Media venue dogma. Book fandom dogma.

Dogma eat Dogma book competition, avoidance of metaphor to metaphor translations of the Great Seal USA metaphors.

Context blindness, context fixation. Anti-diversity of music lyrics, singsong poetry.

Latin Great Seal of the United States of America langauge.     
from the Latin word caecus, meaning "blind" and contextus, meaning "context"
