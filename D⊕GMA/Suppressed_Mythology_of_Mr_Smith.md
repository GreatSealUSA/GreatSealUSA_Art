* "The profundity and **sublime majesty of the suppressed mythology** can be appreciated best by way of two apparently unrelated clocks, one, the ultimate clock of outer space, and the other of inner space-respectively, the astronomical precession of the equinoxes and the physiological beat of the human heart." -- The Inner Reaches of Outer Space, 1986, page 12

BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut — by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that **television has made a global village** of the world — but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have **disqualified themselves for the future** (Summer of 1986).

BILL MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

BILL MOYERS: There is something about that on **the Great Seal of the United States**.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: That’s what the **Great Seal** is all about.
