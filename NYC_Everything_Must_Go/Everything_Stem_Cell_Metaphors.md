NOTE: like so much... what a mess, Move this to Pluribus, and I just tossed in some notes while half-asleep at 25 or 6 to 04:00 A.M. from thoughts and an accidental typo in search engine inspiration.

## גֹּלֶם

Psalm 139:16    
Genesis 2:7 stem cells and food - metaphors for clay to make any shape cell.   

cell of a hive, cell of a body. גֹּלֶם

We the People of the world. We claim the origins of John 1:1 

The hive mind is called גֹּלֶם by Carol that they have taken Helen.

That biological matter of the hive mind. Unformed.

Carol's unformed choices of motherhood and pregnancy. Stem cells being flexible / dynamic / capable of producing many kinds of cells, morphing - like the hive mind with multiple cells / faces.

ToDo: The airplan crash in Breaking Bad, transportation crashes, Carol Drink driving. Death by the Earth crashing into a celestial object or a passing by transportation device is widly accepted. Health Care system in USA death cheered on as profit-making. Death from acohol consumption.
