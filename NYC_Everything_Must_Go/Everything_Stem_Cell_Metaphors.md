## גֹּלֶם

Psalm 139:16

We the People of the world. We claim the origins of John 1:1 

The hive mind is called גֹּלֶם by Carol that they ahve taken Helen.

That biological matter of the hive mind. Unformed.

Carol's unformed choices of motherhood and pregnancy. Stem cells being flexible / dynamic / capable of producing many kinds of cells, morphing - like the hive mind with multiple cells / faces.

OPERA_A The Who Face Dances. 

ToDo: The airplan crash in Breaking Bad, transportation crashes, Carol Drink driving. Death by the Earth crashing into a celestial object or a passing by transportation device is widly accepted. Health Care system in USA death cheered on as profit-making. Death from acohol consumption.
