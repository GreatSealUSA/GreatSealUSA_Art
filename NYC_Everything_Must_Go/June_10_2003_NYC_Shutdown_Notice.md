## Caution! Echoland! 

"Caution! Echoland! - James Joyce, Finnegans Wake

This echos a New York Professor of Sarah Lawrence College who made a statement in NYC interview in 1987 shortly before his death at age 83. "1986 at George Lucas’ Skywalker Ranch and later at the **Museum of Natural History in New York**."

What did he say from History Museum in New York City in 1987:

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: But in the Bible, eternity withdraws, and nature is corrupt, nature has fallen. In biblical thinking, we live in exile.

BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut—by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?

CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. It’s a **terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future.**

MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?

CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.

CAMPBELL: That’s what **the Great Seal is all about**. I carry a copy of the Great Seal in my pocket in the form of a dollar bill.
