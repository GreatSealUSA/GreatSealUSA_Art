# *Pluribus* For Atheists

The EQUATION of concern with the Founding Fathers Great Seal of the United States of America year 1776 values.

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, [Thou Art That](https://old.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/24qil2/thou_art_that_or_tat_tvam_asi/): Transforming Religious Metaphor

This is beyond crisis

1. September 11, 2001 is at the core of this crisis. Again, this quote is before October 31, 1987!

2. Saturday October 7, 2023 is at the core of this crisis the equation describes!

3. Half + Half = Whole. 50% + 50% = 100%! This is WORLD WIDE, out of Africa concern of the pyramid on the Nile river! This is a critical understanding equation of human history! This year 1776 ideals took years to encode into symbolism! The Atlantic ocean and Pacific ocean separation from peer pressure conformity!
    * Keep in mind Manhattan is named after Native American tribes. The Founding Fathers encountered spoken languages (Tower of Babel metaphor) and religions that had ZERO INFLUENCE from Levant science fiction trilogy fandoms!
    * "I will **never forget the experience** I had when I was in Japan, a place that never heard of the Fall and the Garden of Eden. One of the Shinto texts says that the processes of nature cannot be evil. Every natural impulse is not to be corrected but to be sublimated, to be beautified." - [Summer of year 1986. Luke Skywalker Ranch California USA.
