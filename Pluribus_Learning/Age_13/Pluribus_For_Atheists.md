# *Pluribus* For Atheists

The EQUATION of concern with the Founding Fathers Great Seal of the United States of America year 1776 values.

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, [Thou Art That](https://old.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/24qil2/thou_art_that_or_tat_tvam_asi/): Transforming Religious Metaphor      
Died October 30, 1987 at age 83 (authored before then, date not located)     

This is beyond crisis

1. September 11, 2001 is at the core of this crisis. Again, this quote is before October 31, 1987!

2. Saturday October 7, 2023 is at the core of this crisis the equation describes!

3. Half + Half = Whole. 50% + 50% = 100%! This is WORLD WIDE, out of Africa concern of the pyramid on the Nile river! This is a critical understanding equation of human history! This year 1776 ideals took years to encode into symbolism! The Atlantic ocean and Pacific ocean separation from peer pressure conformity!
    * Keep in mind Manhattan is named after Native American tribes. The Founding Fathers encountered spoken languages (Tower of Babel metaphor) and religions that had ZERO INFLUENCE from Levant science fiction trilogy fandoms!
    * "I will **never forget the experience** I had when I was in Japan, a place that never heard of the Fall and the Garden of Eden. One of the Shinto texts says that the processes of nature cannot be evil. Every natural impulse is not to be corrected but to be sublimated, to be beautified." - [Summer of year 1986. Luke Skywalker Ranch California USA.

# Summer of 1986, Disqualified

&nbsp;

Summer of 1986, age 82, Skywalker Ranch California USA lessons for science fiction fandoms. Filmed by George Lucas at the very peak of his influence and power, 1986 was a wild year for Lucas sustained since year 1977! [Book on paper, "Power of Myth" published year 1988, page thirty](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA30&dq=%22That+is+an+interesting+idea+because,+even+though+the+cities+emerge+around+them,+within+the+soul%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X).

&nbsp;

BILL MOYERS: “Holding their own head.” That is an interesting idea because, even though the cities emerge around them, within the soul, the place where the inner person dwells, they are still, as you say, in accord with nature.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: But in the Bible, **eternity withdraws, and nature is corrupt, nature has fallen**. In biblical thinking, we live in exile.

MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut—by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that [television has made a global village of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace_in_the_Global_Village) — but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?

CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These **three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future**.

MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?

CAMPBELL: We need myths that will **identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet**. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.

CAMPBELL: That’s what the Great Seal is all about. I carry a copy of the Great Seal in my pocket in the form of a dollar bill. Here is the statement of the ideals that brought about the formation of the United States. Look at this dollar bill. Now here is the Great Seal of the United States. Look at the pyramid on the left.

* “Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light‐years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage **such as those** of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.”

# Eden? Of Course Not!

&nbsp;

CAMPBELL: Unnameable. Unnameable. It is transcendent of all names.

MOYERS: God?

CAMPBELL: “God” is an ambiguous word in our language because it appears to refer to something that is known. But the transcendent is unknowable and unknown. God is transcendent, finally, of anything like the name “God.” God is beyond names and forms. Meister Eckhart said that the ultimate and highest leave-taking is leaving God for God, leaving your notion of God for an experience of that which transcends all notions.
The mystery of life is beyond all human conception. Everything we know is within the terminology of the concepts of being and not being, many and single, true and untrue. We always think in terms of opposites. But God, the ultimate, is beyond the pairs of opposites, that is all there is to it.

MOYERS: Why do we think in terms of opposites?

CAMPBELL: Because we can’t think otherwise.

MOYERS: That’s the nature of reality in our time.

CAMPBELL: That’s the nature of our experience of reality.

MOYERS: Man-woman, life-death, good-evil—

CAMPBELL: —I and you, this and that, true and untrue—every one of them has its opposite. But mythology suggests that behind that duality there is a singularity over which this plays like a shadow game. “Eternity is in love with the productions of time,” says the poet Blake.

MOYERS: What does that mean, “Eternity is in love with the productions of time”?

CAMPBELL: The source of temporal life is eternity. Eternity pours itself into the world. It is a basic mythic idea of the god who becomes many in us. In India, the god who lies in me is called the “inhabitant” of the body. To identify with that divine, immortal aspect of yourself is to identify yourself with divinity.

Now, eternity is beyond all categories of thought. This is an important point in all of the great Oriental religions. We want to think about God. God is a thought. God is a name. God is an idea. But its reference is to something that transcends all thinking. The ultimate mystery of being is beyond all categories of thought. As Kant said, the thing in itself is no thing. It transcends thingness, it goes past anything that could be thought. The best things can’t be told because they transcend thought. The second best are misunderstood, because those are the thoughts that are supposed to refer to that which can’t be thought about. The third best are what we talk about. And myth is that field of reference to what is absolutely transcendent.

MOYERS: What can’t be known or named except in our feeble attempt to clothe it in language.

CAMPBELL: The ultimate word in our English language for that which is transcendent is God. But then you have a concept, don’t you see? You think of God as the father. Now, in religions where the god or creator is the mother, the whole world is her body. There is nowhere else. The male god is usually somewhere else. But male and female are two aspects of one principle. The division of life into sexes was a late division. Biologically, the amoeba isn’t male and female. The early cells are just cells. They divide and become two by asexual reproduction. I don’t know at what levels sexuality comes in, but it’s late. That’s why it’s absurd to speak of God as of either this sex or that sex. The divine power is antecedent to sexual separation.

MOYERS: But isn’t the only way a human being can try to grope with this immense idea to assign it a language that he or she understands? God, he, God, she —

CAMPBELL: Yes, but you don’t understand it if you think it is a he or a she. The he or a she is a springboard to spring you into the transcendent, and transcendent means to “transcend,” to go past duality. Everything in the field of time and space is dual. The incarnation appears either as male or as female, and each of us is the incarnation of God. You’re born in only one aspect of your actual metaphysical duality, you might say. This is represented in the mystery religions, where an individual goes through a series of initiations opening him out inside into a deeper and deeper depth of himself, and there comes a moment when he realizes that he is both mortal and immortal, both male and female.

MOYERS: Do you think there was such a place as the Garden of Eden?

CAMPBELL: Of course not.

# Two Eden

REMINDER / ASSERTION OF CONTEXT: This page is age 13 and above. Malala Yousafzai's first Internet World Wide Web blog post was published on the exact date of January 3, 2009. She was 11 years old at the time. 

ToDo:

1. MLK Jr. quote about tough mind and two ideas of opposites in mind

2. John Stewart Interview with Malala where Stewart  jokes about Garden of Eden State, and Malala saying Swat Valley is Eden on Earth. That she believes in *two*.


It’s a different problem from that of psychoanalysis. I think it was Nietzsche who said, “Be careful lest in casting out the devils you cast out the best thing that’s in you.” Here, the deities who have been encountered—powers, let’s call them—are retained. The connection is maintained, not broken. And these men then become the spiritual advisers and gift-givers to their people.

Well, what happened with this **young boy** was that he had a prophetic vision of the terrible future of his tribe. It was a vision of what he called “the hoop” of the nation. In the vision, Black Elk saw that the hoop of his nation was one of many hoops, which is something that we haven’t learned at all well yet. He saw the cooperation of all the hoops, all the nations in grand procession. But more than that, the vision was an experience of himself as going through the realms of spiritual imagery that were of his culture and assimilating their import. It comes to one great statement, which for me is a key statement to the understanding of myth and symbols. He says, “I saw myself on the central mountain of the world, the highest place, and I had a vision because I was seeing in the sacred manner of the world.” And the sacred central mountain was Harney Peak in South Dakota. And then he says, “But the central mountain is everywhere.”

* “Once I had asked God for one or two extra inches in height, but instead he made me as tall as the sky, so high that I could not measure myself.” ― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. October 8, 2013

That is a **real mythological realization. It distinguishes between the local** cult image, Harney Peak, and its connotation as the center of the world. The center of the world is the axis mundi, the central point, the pole around which all revolves. The central point of the world is the point where stillness and movement are together. Movement is time, but stillness is eternity. Realizing how this moment of your life is actually a moment of eternity, and experiencing the eternal aspect of what you’re doing in the temporal experience — this is the mythological experience.

So is the central mountain of the world Jerusalem? Rome? Benares? Lhasa? Mexico City?

MOYERS: This Indian boy was saying there is a shining point where all lines intersect.

CAMPBELL: That’s exactly what he was saying.

MOYERS: And he was saying God has no circumference?
