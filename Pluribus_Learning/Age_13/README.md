# Introduction to: Myth Think

"What explains the relationship between these symbols and the Masons, and the fact that so many of these founding fathers belonged to the Masonic order? Is the Masonic order an expression somehow of **mythological thinking**?" - Bill Moyers, [The Power of Myth, year 1988 book, page 37](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA37&dq=%22Is+the+Masonic+order+an+expression+somehow+of+mythological+thinking%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

Bill Moyers worked for the White House as a communications director. A man who was surrounded with the symbols of the Great Seal of the United States of America and POTUS Seal. Not your typical interviwer.
