“.. the United States has broken with the values that it helped to establish .. “.. we have now moved beyond the stage where we can lament the lack of respect for international law or the erosion of the international order; we are far beyond that, I believe.” - Friday, January 9, 2026

# Free Masons values: Great Seal of the USA

**"We Are Now On One Side Of The Pyramid"**

"And so we are now on one side of the pyramid. **We’ve moved from one to two**. We are politically, **historically**, now a member of one side of an argument. We do not represent that principle of the eye up there. And all of our concerns have to do with economics and politics and not with the voice and sound of reason."

The Free Masons symbolism has been forgotten. It is unknown today in January 2026. The { comprehension, understanding, education, teaching } has simply not been undertaken.

&nbsp;

Unheard, unknown words in USA: { Deism, Deists }.   
We The People simply have not been educated or taught. Unknown concepts, unlearned, not studied at all. A population that simply does not grasp what deists were or what deism means.

* "Deism is the belief in a creator God who established the universe and its natural laws but does not intervene in human affairs or reveal Himself through scripture, miracles, or prophets, relying instead on reason and nature as sources of divine understanding; deists, like Thomas Paine or Benjamin Franklin, see God as a "divine clockmaker" who set things in motion but leaves humanity to its own rational devices, rejecting organized religion's supernatural claims." - Google Search summary. 2026-01-09 morning USA

# We Mocked Values All Away

We Mocked and Mocked and Mocked our values down to one side of the pyramid.

 * "they dismiss them as naïve dreamers and my own Western attachment to such vague notions as “human rights” and “freedom” as a blunder. “Can’t you see your own governments are just as bad as ours?” they ask me. I try to protest — but **they just smile and pity me.** To **believe in something and stand by it in this world is derided**, the ability to be a shape-shifter celebrated." - year 2014
 
 * "now there is no need to constantly change their colors, but they continue to **do so out of a sort of dark joy, conformism** raised to the level of aesthetic act." - year 2014

* "you notice how they all seem to perform their roles with a little ironic twinkle.” - year 2014

Mocking voices, a mocking sound, a mocking tone, an ironic twinkle, a LOL smirk. We Mocked and Mocked and Mocked our values down to one side of the pyramid.

We The People, **We Mocked It All Away**. We mocked our Free Masons teachings and art work understanding away in the name of bad-sport amusement and bad-faith jokes. Bad jokes, bad mocking, bad outcomes.

We, We All, We The People, We and Us, Plrubus... are far beyond that Friday December 5, 2014 opening book tour / first public book reading warning of what was already underway. What we mocked our way into with bad-faith memes, bad-faith joking, bad-sport amusement, mockery and total mockery. "we have now moved beyond the stage where we can lament the lack of respect for international law or the erosion of the international order; we are far beyond that" - Friday, January 9, 2026

This is not a mind case of "Brain Rot", "Morality Rot". We have burned the self-awareness to even comprehend our own self-mockery and anti-humanism. We joked and laughed our nation into such a stupor that we, We The People, no longer realize or grasp what we laughed away.

&nbsp;

# We Are In The End

We are not reaching the end, we are inside the end. This is the anti-goodness ending of our constant faith in more jokes, more mocking, total saturation mockery.

* “For in the end, he was trying to tell us what afflicted the people in 'Brave New World' was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business

## 🎼 *Trust in You*

* "This is the first nation in the world that was ever established on the basis of reason instead of simply warfare. These were eighteenth-century deists, these gentlemen. Over here we read, “In God ***We Trust***.” But that is **not the god of the Bible. These men did not believe in a Fall.** They did not think the mind of man was cut off from God. The mind of man, cleansed of secondary and merely temporal concerns, beholds with the radiance of a cleansed mirror a reflection of the rational mind of God. Reason puts you in touch with God. Consequently, for these men, there is no special revelation anywhere, and none is needed."

We mocked it all away. We mocked and mocked and mocked. We joked, we memed, we amused at the suffering.
