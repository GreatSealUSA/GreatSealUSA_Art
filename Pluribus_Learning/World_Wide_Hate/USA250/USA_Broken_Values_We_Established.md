# USA: Broken Values, We Established

Friday, January 9, 2026 morning USA

Front page of Reddit social media /r/All

“.. the United States has broken with the values that it helped to establish .. “.. we have now moved beyond the stage where we can lament the lack of respect for international law or the erosion of the international order; we are far beyond that, I believe.” - Friday, January 9, 2026

# Free Masons values: Great Seal of the USA

**"We Are Now On One Side Of The Pyramid"**

"And so we are now on one side of the pyramid. **We’ve moved from one to two**. We are politically, **historically**, now a member of one side of an argument. We do not represent that principle of the eye up there. And all of our concerns have to do with economics and politics and not with the voice and sound of reason."

The Free Masons symbolism has been forgotten. It is unknown today in January 2026. The { comprehension, understanding, education, teaching } has simply not been undertaken.

# We Mocked Values All Away

We Mocked and Mocked and Mocked our values down to one side of the pyramid.

 * "they dismiss them as naïve dreamers and my own Western attachment to such vague notions as “human rights” and “freedom” as a blunder. “Can’t you see your own governments are just as bad as ours?” they ask me. I try to protest — but they just smile and pity me. To **believe in something and stand by it in this world is derided**, the ability to be a shape-shifter celebrated." - year 2014
 
 * "now there is no need to constantly change their colors, but they continue to **do so out of a sort of dark joy, conformism** raised to the level of aesthetic act." - year 2014

* "you notice how they all seem to perform their roles with a little ironic twinkle.” - year 2014

A mocking tone, an ironic twinkle, a LOL smirk. We Mocked and Mocked and Mocked our values down to one side of the pyramid.

We The People, **We Mocked It All Away**. We mocked our Free Masons teachings and art work understanding away in the name of bad-sport amusement and jokes. Bad jokes, bad mocking, bad outcomes.
