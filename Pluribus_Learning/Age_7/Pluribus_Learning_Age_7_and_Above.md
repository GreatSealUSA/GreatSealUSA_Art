"The "Taco Bell Dollar Menu Illuminati" refers to Taco Bell's clever 2017-2018 marketing campaign, "The Belluminati," which humorously linked its $1 value menu items (like the Triple Melt Burrito) to the secretive Illuminati, suggesting that buying these affordable items was like gaining entry into a hidden society controlling the world's low prices, much to the amusement (and some confusion) of conspiracy theorists like musician Charlie Daniels. 
What it was:"

* "Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of confusion and bamboozle requires vigilance, dedication and courage. But if we don’t practice these tough habits of thought, we cannot hope to solve the truly serious problems that face us and we risk becoming a nation of suckers" ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 38

Celebration of Ignorance    

Please review: it is import to understand. The anti-intellectual cult problems.   
[Year 1987 review of the situation of education on the Great Seal of the United States of America](/TwoAndOnlyTw0/Utterly_Deplorable_and_Regrettable_and_Terrible.md)

* “There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.”
― Isaac Asimov, year 1980. https://aphelis.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ASIMOV_1980_Cult_of_Ignorance.pdf

# Most printed paper $1

How many paper ships have been traded with this pyramid and eagle on them, yet ignorance abounds. There are copies of these symbols all over in wallets, purses, pockets, cash registers, stapled or framed on walls of taverns, bars, and other public houses.

What kind of national pride and 

The VERY BEST of the Founding Fathers.

We can face the horrific reality of slavery being in The Bible imported from the Levant, we can face the reality of adult women not being give the right to vote.

But we can not face the very best goodness of the founding fathers? What kind of patriotism and pride in humanity is that? That we can't be proud of a teaching and spiritual system that promotes world peace and mutual understanding, democracy?

We have a diamond covered in badness. How native Americans / first peoples / native peoples were treated. How slavery was carried into the nation from The Bible of 1,700 years earlier. How women were not allowed to vote. But we avoid the best part, a "We is All of Us" Pluribus system that is printed on slips of paper we carry all over?
