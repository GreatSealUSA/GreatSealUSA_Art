# Pluribus Learning: Age 21

* "Now back to the Great Seal. When you count the number of ranges on this pyramid, you find there are thirteen. And when you come to the bottom, there is an inscription in Roman numerals. It is, of course, 1776. Then, when you add one and seven and seven and six, **you get twenty-one, which is the age of reason**, is it not? It was in 1776 that the thirteen states declared independence. The number thirteen is the number of transformation and rebirth."

I can feel no sense of measure    
No illusions as we take    
Refuge in young man's pleasure (Age 21 Rituals)    
Breaking down the dreams [We make real](/PLUR1BUS/E_pluribus_unum_Opera/Great_Seal_We_The_People_Opera.md)    

One down one to go...    
Another town and one more show    
Downtown they're giving away   
But she never came back    

No phone can take your place    
Do you know what I mean?    

We have the same intrigue    
[As a court of kings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz2CAtExXgQ)     
Ah leave it, ah leave it     

Two down there you go!     
McArthur Park in the driving snow    
Uptown they're digging it out    
Better lay your claim     
Get home you're not alone    
You just broke out of the danger zone    

Be there to show your face   
On another dreamy day    
Ah leave it, ah leave it

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye bad    
Leave it    
Hello, hello, heaven    

Breaking down the dreams we make real    
Ah leave it, ah leave it     
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye bad    
Leave it     
Hello, hello, heaven     
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye bad    
Leave it     
Hello, hello, heaven
