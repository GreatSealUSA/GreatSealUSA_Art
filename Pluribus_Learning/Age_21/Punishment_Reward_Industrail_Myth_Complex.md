# Punishment & Reward: Industrial Myth Complex

"a child is compelled to give up its childhood and become an adult — to die, you might say, to its infantile personality and psyche and come back as a responsible adult. This is a fundamental psychological transformation that everyone has to undergo. We are in childhood in a condition of dependency under someone’s protection and supervision **for some fourteen to twenty-one years** — and if you’re going on for your Ph. D., this may continue to perhaps [**thirty-five**](../Age_35). You are in no way a self-responsible, free agent, but an obedient dependent, expecting and receiving punishments and rewards. To evolve out of this position of psychological immaturity to the courage of self-responsibility and assurance requires a death and a resurrection."

Frienemies, who **when you're down** ain't your friend
