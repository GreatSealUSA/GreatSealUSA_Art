# Transistor Radio City

Five names that I can hardly stand to hear: Including yours and mine and one more chimp who isn't here!    
I can see the ladies talking how the times are getting hard...   
And that fearsome excavation on Magnolia Boulevard.    
Yes, I'm *going* insane!
And I'm laughing at the frozen rain!    

Well, I'm so alone!   
Honey, when they gonna send me home?    

Bad sneakers and a piña colada, *my friend*    
Stomping on the avenue by Radio City with a Transistor and a large sum of money to spend.    
You fella: *you*, tearing up the street! *You*, wear that white tuxedo, how you gonna beat the heat?     
Do you take me for a fool?   
Do you think that I don't see?    
That ditch out in the valley that they're digging just for me?     

**Yes**, I'm going insane    
You know I'm laughing at the frozen rain... 
And I feel like I'm so alone....
