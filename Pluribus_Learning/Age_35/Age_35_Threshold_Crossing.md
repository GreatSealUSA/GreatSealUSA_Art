Now in contrast to that, let me conclude by reviewing the four ages as described by Dante in that wonderful work of his The Convivio. In the last chapters of The Convito of Dante, he says, "Life falls into four stages."

Now he was thirty-five in the year 1300. His dates are 1265 to 1321. It was a theory in the Middle Ages that 1300 was the middle year of the world --- the world had been created somewhere about 4000 or so B.C. And we are in the middle year now. So Dante --- the middle year of Dante's life (he took 35 as the mid-year of life) fell in the mid-year of the world's life, and he had his decent to Hell, Purgatory, and ascent to Heaven on the Good Friday to Easter weekend of that fabulous year. So he united his individual curve with the cosmic curve of all that kind of thing --- we have a straight line through.

He says, "Life divides at thirty-five." Now the first quarter of life --- he gives twenty five years to that. The first twenty-five years of life he calls The Period of Increase and Adolescence --- that of growing up and increase. And the virtues of those years --- they sound rather strange in relation to what we have been seeing lately --- they are obedience, sense of shame, grace, and beauty. Those are the virtues of youth --- albeit \[circa\] 1300.

The middle period, Maturity, stretches from twenty-five to forty-five with thirty-five as the mid-point. These are the years of fulfillment of your role in society, as society understands them. The virtues are reason, courage, love, and loyalty --- and courteousness. But at the thirty-five age, a crisis occurs. This is the crisis symbolized in Dante's Divine Comedy of individual realization of those truths which were suggested by the tradition in which you were brought up. Let's say you just don't accept tradition. Tradition leads you to a moment of your own personal realization of truth in the mystery of being.

We come then to the period which he calls Of Age, from forty-five to seventy. This is not a period of retirement to the forest. This is not a period of self-erasure. In the course of your twenty years of maturity, you have come to your own judgments, your own realizations, your own evaluations, and now you put them into affect in the world. This is the age for the senators --- for the governors, for participation in the government, or for teaching; this is the age of giving.

First was growth, next was maturity and fulfillment of your role, and now it's the age of giving of your wisdom --- your own wisdom, not repeating traditional wisdom. And the virtues now are of prudence, and wisdom, magnanimity, generosity. It is generally one of giving, unloading, giving your treasure to the world.

And then from seventy onwards, this is the period that he calls The Period of Departure. And it is typified as follows: looking backward over the span of your life with gratitude, and looking forward to death as a return home. There is that sense of appreciation of the void and the abyss, and yet of appreciation for life. You leave life in a nice balance, not resenting your departure, nor resenting what life did to you.
