# Not Supposed To Be A Secret

The Great Seal was printed everywhere. It is on the Dollar Bill currency. It isn't supposed to be a secret! It is difficult, complex, Bible verse Romans 11:33 complex.

* [Bible verse Romans 11:33[(https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm) challenge of the Eye above the Pyramid: "Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!"

&nbsp;

* "This is the first nation in the world that was ever established on the basis of reason instead of simply warfare. These were eighteenth-century **deists**, these gentlemen. Over here we read, "In God We Trust." But that is not the god of the Bible. These men **did not believe in a Fall**. They did not think the mind of man was cut off from God. The mind of man, cleansed of secondary and merely temporal concerns, beholds with the radiance of a cleansed mirror a reflection of the rational mind of God. Reason puts you in touch with God. Consequently, for these men, **there is no special revelation anywhere**, and none is needed, because the mind of man cleared of its fallibilities is **sufficiently capable of the knowledge of God**. All people in the world are thus capable because all people in the world are capable of reason. All men are capable of reason. That is the fundamental principle of democracy. Because everybody's mind is capable of true knowledge, you don't have to have a special authority, or a special revelation telling you that this is the way things should be." - Skywalking lessons from Skywalker Ranch California. published year 1988.

### Page Notes

Finn's Hotel 1923 onward inspiration for this folder and title: "primarily refers to the Hole-in-the-Wall pub in Dublin's Phoenix Park, symbolizing barriers, entrances/exits, history (like Stonehenge), and the constant cycles of enclosure and release (the fall of Finnegan/HCE). It connects to the novel's central themes of confinement (the wall keeping people in/out), access (the turnstile), and the "offwall" or "omphalos" (center) of history and Dublin life, representing both **literal structure and mythical space.**" - Google Search Summary 2025-12-18 morning USA ; literary space / mythical space / literary metaphors
