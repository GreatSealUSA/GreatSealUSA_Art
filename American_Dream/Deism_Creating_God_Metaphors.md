# Deism Peering Eye to Eye with God

Deism is about Peering Eye to Eye with God.      
Scientific tools and reason thinking, such as the [James Webb Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope). Networks of stars, shining above the Eagle on the Great Seal of the United Sates of America. Reflecting as [Indra's Net of Gems metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net), what the Hubble Space Telescope a generation before was also seeking.    

The stars shine and [reflect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net#In_the_Buddh%C4%81vata%E1%B9%83saka_S%C5%ABtra) and create light (photon) interference particles and waves.

Some depictions even have a pyramid like triangle focus. Telescope mirror metaphors abound.
