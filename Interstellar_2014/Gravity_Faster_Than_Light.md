To them, one of these happened first, and both points of view are equally valid, but in the case of gravity, this leads to disaster.

1:53     
Say you see the sun disappearing and earth flying off at the same time as Newton predicted,
then the other observer sees something impossible. They see the earth flying off first, even while the sun is still there
and it should of course be pulling the earth in. So to them, it looks like cause and effect are reversed.

The only way out of this paradox is to reject the assumption we started with. So gravity can't be instant.
It took Einstein 10 years to fix this issue, and in the process he completely overhauled our
understanding of gravity. Gravity is caused by the bending of spacetime. When there's a change in gravity
that only affects the local space time, and then that ripple spreads out to nearby regions which spread farther out
until eventually they reach us. This theory of gravity is local because effects spread from place to place at the speed
of light instead of being instant from our frame of reference. If the sun disappeared, that ripple would take about eight minutes to reach us.

Another observer might disagree about the length of the delay, but now we all agree that the sun disappeared first.
This is why nothing can go faster than light. The delay between cause and effect ensures all observers agree on the order.
After Einstein fixed gravity, all of classical physics obeyed this important rule. But then Einstein studied the new theory
of quantum mechanics and made a terrible discovery.

3:15     
This is one of the most famous photographs in physics. It was taken at the 1927 Solvay Conference
where the architects of the brand new quantum theory gathered to discuss it. Around 60% of the attendees would win Nobel prizes,
but Einstein thought they'd gotten something fundamentally wrong and this was his chance to prove it.

So he took to the stage with a thought experiment. Imagine you fire a single electron through a narrow slit toward a circular detection screen.
Well, quantum mechanics says that this electron has some sort of wave associated with it called a wave function, which spreads out
through space as it travels. When the electron hits the screen, you detect it at a single point.
Where it turns up depends on the amplitude of the wave. If the wave is very big in a particular area,
the electron is more likely to turn up there. Let's say it appears here, so far, everyone was following.

4:04     
This is what quantum mechanics predicts, but Einstein's next question surprised them. Why doesn't the electron turn up at this other
spot a moment later? There's only one electron, so we can't detect it twice, but the way quantum mechanics ensures this is
that when the electron was detected at the first spot, its wave function collapsed to zero everywhere else instantly.

That's why the probability of finding it at the second spot is now a zero. There's no longer any wave there,
but Einstein asked the audience to think about what this means. The measurement here must instantly affect the wave function
over here no matter how far apart these locations are. In other words, quantum mechanics requires instant
influences across distance. It violates locality.

4:48     
Einstein concluded his talk by saying this is an entirely peculiar mechanism of action at a distance,
and that this implies to my mind a contradiction with the postulate of relativity. Einstein's argument was so simple
and his talk so short that people didn't know what to make of it. One audience member said, 'I feel myself in a very difficult position
because I don't understand what precisely is the point which Einstein wants to make. No doubt it is my fault.'

That man was Niels Bohr, the most influential figure in quantum physics at the time.
Bohr's Institute in Copenhagen had become the hub for the new field. Dozens of young scientists like Werner Heisenberg
