Immediate grasp on release, much like the first impressions of the dollar bill Great Seal of the United States of America.

1. 13 missions
2. 13 modules to the space ship https://youtu.be/iWrFVvEgFYI?t=441 (12 + center dock)  
3. Corn Pollen Path of North America
4. Three surviving crops, Okra then Corn. North America world discovery.
5. NASA is the agency that survives, but no Canadian or India / Japan / Chinese staff symbolism

Great Seal stars above the Eagles metaphors abound.

1. Bookshelf thumping / Bible thumping USA metaphors. Conflicts of the Great Seal, "1 John 4:20" Bible verse crisis. PUtting one and only one book above the entire bookshelf for Murph. Mankind's betrayal of spiritual Great Seal coming together. https://youtu.be/iWrFVvEgFYI?t=581

Matthew McConaughey's character in Contact film. And his mother is a teacher.

Love is the key    
EVERY person love, not just those who sing like the greatest singers or poets. We the People and our personal voices, popularity isn't the concern.

Intentional, we Pluribus (We The People) not understanding each other   
Even beyond the loud moments    
People don't understand the dollar bill, in their face their whole life. One has to make effort

* "Now, where do these aspirations come from? They come from a very wonderful, **childlike thing**: fascination. You know, if you wanted to make money today… I think I know economists, but I'll bet the thing to do would be to invest your money in something like cameras — things that people play with, things that they are fascinated by. These fascinations are the creations of new activities. And when we look at the old cultures we can see — and some of it is very strange to see indeed…" - Lecture I.1.1 - The Celebration of Life. Joseph Campbell. March 1, 1967

Matthew McConaughey saying inward...

* "For example, Jesus ascended to heaven. The denotation would seem to be that somebody ascended to the sky. That’s literally what is being said. But if that were really the meaning of the message, then we have to throw it away, because there would have been no such place for Jesus literally to go. We know that Jesus could not have ascended to heaven because there is no physical heaven anywhere in the universe. Even ascending at the speed of light, Jesus would still be in the galaxy. Astronomy and physics have simply eliminated that as a literal, physical possibility. But if you read “Jesus ascended to heaven” in terms of its metaphoric connotation, you see that he has gone inward — **not into outer space but into inward space**, to the place from which all being comes, into the consciousness that is the source of all things, the kingdom of heaven within. The images are outward, but **their reflection is inward**. The point is that we should ascend with him by going inward. It is a metaphor of returning to the source, alpha and omega, of leaving the fixation on the body behind and going to the body’s dynamic source."

"¿Es necesario el sonido irritante de notificacion de mensajes? Al final es un resumen aburrido de la película narrado por una I.A.     
No tiene sentido tu video."

Computer generated junk?
