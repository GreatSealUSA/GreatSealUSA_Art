# Floor 14 above 13 Greed

Metaphors abound. On the [Eve of 1976, on the Eve of 200 years USA, a NYC story was told](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Lied) about falling from 14 to the street. On an album titled with liar themes.

When Black Friday comes    
I'll stand down by the door     
And catch the gray men when they    
Dive from the **fourteenth floor**    
When Black Friday comes    
I'll collect everything I'm owed    
And before my friends find out   
I'll be on the road    
When Black Friday **falls**
