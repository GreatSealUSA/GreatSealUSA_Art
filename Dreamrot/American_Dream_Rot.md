"Clearly something significant has changed. And it has affected the very nature of what selves are. What humans are. What subjects are. When I talked about how my students had no dreams, I mean, what is there left to dream? When I was a kid I dreamed about dinosaurs. I had a little Walt Disney dinosaur book. Why would I need to dream about dinosaurs now? Steven Spielberg has made them. He has filmed them. They are more real than real dinosaurs. They are hyperreal. You would be disappointed if you saw a real Tyrannosaurus Rex after the movie. You would be disappointed. It wouldn’t be as noisy or as scary or as frightening. The same is true of Jaws, you know. I have actually caught some rather large sharks, I mean, I like to fish – you know, pier fish – so I have caught a few sharks, some of fairly good size. But those real experiences are so boring compared to Jaws. I mean Jaws is a hyperreal experience." - year 1993
