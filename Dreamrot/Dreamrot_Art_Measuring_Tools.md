Finnegans Wake is a Measuring Tool of Cheery-picking behavior. What people prize, what people desire to hear, the cravings.

 John Bishop in his introduction to the wake: "...readers with specialistic kinds of expertise will discover in Finnegans Wake elaborate treatments of matters of which Joyce could not possibly have been aware: cyberneticians are currently discovering prefigurations of cybernetics in the book, while Robert Anton Wilson, author of The Illuminatus Trilogy, in a reading that cleverly demonstrates the authorial power of the postmodern reader, has discovered in Finnegans Wake both the formula for the hydrogen bomb and the molecular structure of the double helix of DNA."

 * "Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966

Because it is an eye test, the eye of the beholder test.       
What you see at age 27 will not be the same as what you see at age 28.     
that's the Holy Bible, Holy Quran. And we are not "woke" to this "wake" Finnegans!

The pyramid stones metaphors    

* On James Joyce: "Bygmester Finnegan, of the Stuttering Hand, freemen's mau- rer" (page 4, lines 18-19). This is a direct pun on "Freemason's maurer" (German for mason). The name "Bygmester Finnegan" (Danish for "master builder") reinforces this architectural and Masonic theme.
