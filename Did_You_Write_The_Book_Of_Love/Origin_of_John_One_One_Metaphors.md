Assertions

1. King George Origins of { Church, Bible } Special Revelations

2. We The People started to Free Will Singing

3. This Will Be The Day I Die: Back to Step Zero, Drawing Board, Planning Boards, of the Pyramid

4. Bye Bye American Pie: I met a Girl who Sang the Blues, The Man Said the Music Would No Longer Play

5. The Poets Dreamed: New American Dreams From Among { We Us All }

# This Will Be: They Were Singing

Did you SingSong the Book of Love?    
If *The Bible* Tells You So?   

That  has become our problem: Fixation on one book of King James English. Fixation on "One And Only One Book" of Metaphors entangeled Levant Science Fiction Trillogy { Quran, Torah, Bible }.

Despite Local United States of America adaptations, { The Book of Mormon } = supplements to the main Trilogy - The Tower of Babel metaphors and John One One shifts in meaning have gotten the beret of us.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Well, you find an awful lot of laws in the Old Testament.

BILL MOYERS: But that’s the transformation of religion to theology. Religion begins with the sense of wonder and awe and the attempt to tell stories that will connect us to God. Then it becomes a set of theological works in which everything is reduced to a code, to a creed.

CAMPBELL: That’s the reduction of mythology to theology. Mythology is very fluid. Most of the myths are self-contradictory. You may even find four or five myths in a given culture, all giving different versions of **the same mystery**. Then theology comes along and says it has got to be just this way. **Mythology is poetry, and the poetic language is very flexible**.

Religion turns poetry into prose. God is literally up there, and this is literally what he thinks, and this is the way you’ve got to behave to get into proper relationship with that god up there.

# 🎼 "That's Not How *It Used To Be*" Renewal

After World War Two, we The People were more flexible and poetic with all the religions of the worlds.

The poetic { old game player / old world order } players try to overtake the field, but the poets and songwriters and creators were handed the drawing boards. And Then We The People Were All in One Place.

No Time To Start Again, We have only Days to be Reborn Again in Seeking World Peace and Harmony. 

No Angel Born in Hell can Break That Satan's Spells!

# Gentle People, We People Together

Skywalking Lessons from Skywalker Ranch California:

BILL MOYERS: That is why there is so much pain associated with the true religious transformation or conversion. **It is not easy to lose yourself**.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: The New Testament (Levant Bible) teaches dying to one’s self, literally suffering the pain of death to the world and its values. This is the **vocabulary of the mystics. Now, suicide is also a symbolic act. It casts off the psychological posture that you happen to be in at the time, so that you may come into a better one. You die to your current life in order to come to another of some kind. But, as Jung says, you’d better not get caught in a symbolic situation. You don’t have to die, really, physically**. All you have to do is die spiritually and be reborn to a larger way of living.

MOYERS: But it seems so foreign to our experience today. Religion is easy. You put it on as if you are putting on a coat and going out to the movies.

They caught the last long train running for the coast.
