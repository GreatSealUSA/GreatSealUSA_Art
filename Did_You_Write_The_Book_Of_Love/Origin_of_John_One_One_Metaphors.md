Assertions

1. King George Origins of { Church, Bible } Special Revelations

2. We The People started to Free Will Singing

3. This Will Be The Day I Die: Back to Step Zero, Drawing Board, Planning Boards, of the Pyramid

4. Bye Bye American Pie: I met a Girl who Sang the Blues, The Man Said the Music Would No Longer Play

5. The Poets Dreamed: New American Dreams From Among { We Us All }

# This Will Be: They Were Singing

Did you SingSong the Book of Love?    
If *The Bible* Tells You So?   

That  has become our problem: Fixation on one book of King James English. Fixation on "One And Only One Book" of Metaphors entangeled Levant Science Fiction Trillogy { Quran, Torah, Bible }.

Despite Local United States of America adaptations, { The Book of Mormon } = supplements to the main Trilogy - The Tower of Babel metaphors and John One One shifts in meaning have gotten the beret of us.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Well, you find an awful lot of laws in the Old Testament.

BILL MOYERS: But that’s the transformation of religion to theology. Religion begins with the sense of wonder and awe and the attempt to tell stories that will connect us to God. Then it becomes a set of theological works in which everything is reduced to a code, to a creed.

CAMPBELL: That’s the reduction of mythology to theology. Mythology is very fluid. Most of the myths are self-contradictory. You may even find four or five myths in a given culture, all giving different versions of **the same mystery**. Then theology comes along and says it has got to be just this way. **Mythology is poetry, and the poetic language is very flexible**.

Religion turns poetry into prose. God is literally up there, and this is literally what he thinks, and this is the way you’ve got to behave to get into proper relationship with that god up there.
