"The Pythagorean Tetractys is a sacred geometric symbol, an equilateral triangle of ten dots in four rows (1+2+3+4=10), representing universal harmony, creation, and mystical knowledge, revered by Pythagoreans who swore oaths by it as a key to understanding numbers, music (ratios 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 4:3), and the cosmos (Musica Universalis), embodying the divine unfolding from Unity (1) to the whole (10)."

1985 summer, Joseph Campbell at California Skywalker Ranch for education of Star Wars audience:

* "They are Masonic signs, and the meaning of the **Pythagorean tetrakys** has been known for centuries. The **information would have been found in Thomas Jefferson's library**. These were, after all, learned men. The eighteenth-century Enlightenment was a world of learned gentlemen. We haven't had men of that quality in politics very much. It's an enormous good fortune for our nation that that cluster of gentlemen had the power and were in a position to influence events at that time." - age 81
