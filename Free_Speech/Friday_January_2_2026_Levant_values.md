# Friday January 2, 2026 Levant values

In the afternoon USA time on Friday January 2, 2026. The front page of Reddit social media site:

Israeli billionaire Shlomo Kramer: "It's time to limit America's First Amendment. We need to control all the social platforms… And take control of what they are saying"

This is the very meaning of "old world order", year 635 Quran / Mecca and previous Levant values systems. Special revelations. The Roman Empire year 380.

Jesus was put to death for speech in the Levant by the government. Bible verses John 19:12-16. That's the "old world order" before year 1776.

# Undefended minds

Our education system has simply not prepared people for media ecology of instant connectivity to the entire world wide web of over 8 billion people.

We want music and movies from all over the world, but we have not educated people on how fiction monomyth stories of Rupert Murdoch and Russia's Kremlin, and Cambridge Analytica can take over minds.

When you have books { Torah, Quran, Bible, Book of Mormon, L Run Hubbard books } that have people imagine science fiction is non-fiction. The Bible verse "1 John 4:20" crisis described in the Levant!

USA we have failed to educate minds for the Internet TCP/IP society. Eternal September took over:

1. 1985 book by Manhattan NYU professor Neil Postman, and really his lifetime library of writing.

2. 1987 book by Joseph Campbell. His lifetime library of work.

3. 1968 book by Marshall McLuhan. War and Peace in the Global Village (World Wide Web)

The answer to these problems is not to *block communications* and prevent information delivery. People have to be able to recognize attractive fiction. Fiction addictions. Nonfiction does not outsell fiction storytelling. This self-awareness is essential at the [Age 13 threshold](/Pluribus_Learning/Age_13)

It is this education of [age 13 threshold](/Pluribus_Learning/Age_13) / age 21 thresholds that is core to this very GitHub project. We are NOT educating people.

ChatGPT and Grok AI and other generative artificial systems can already induced self-harm in people! This isn't just a national issue of information warfare organized by humans! [The ELIZA effect has been witnessed since the 1960's at MIT university. LATE, year 1976 for people to recognize it: "I **had not realized** ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect). The ELIZA effect is the newest fiction problem of Bible verse "1 John 4:20" crisis - teaching human history of this problem, comparative mythology (fiction vs. fiction comparisons) is ESSENTIAL! Not optional in a global information society!
