# Why Free Speech

John 1:1 Bible verse. The Church as an organization claimed the origin of languages and approval of words. That is the "old world order" from the year 1776 Great Seal of the United States of America perspective.

## Responsibility 

We just teach media cults. Echo-chambers, filter-bubbles, cults of meaning.

Free speech without educated population is open to predatory Edward Bernays students. Predatory Cambridge Analytica. Predatory Rupert Murdoch media systems. Predatory cults of symbols / art / messages.

Responsibility to teach

1. Media ecology. What electric media systems do to the mind when over 8 billion people on planet Earth can reach out and message and contact you instantly. "September 19, 1977 — Everybody tends to merge his identity with other people at the speed of light. It's called being mass man. It began quite a long time ago. 07:54" https://www.organism.earth/library/document/mcluhan-mcmanus

2. Great Seal Untied States of America year 1776 understanding of the Eye as John 1:1 - we can coin language, we can create idioms and metaphors, *We The People* are the source of John 1:1 and communications systems / venues / networks / languages / protocols / etc. From John 1:1 some 2,000 years ago Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek... to year 635 Arabic, to discovery of Navajo and Manhattan languages in North America, to a world wide Unicode and TCP/IP protocols, etc. The Eye is symbolism art, a Unicode of art, of art itself, art and metaphors and language, both fiction and nonfiction. We must be self-aware of these and educated to not fall into the Tower of Babel language metaphor conflicts.

3. When it is time to distinguish fiction from nonfiction. Misunderstandings, errors, mistakes, comprehension problems. What is fact, knowledge, accurate from what is creative fiction and creative mythology. We must not rule with the “Old World Order” of using mythological fiction and representing science fiction stories as nonfiction truth.
