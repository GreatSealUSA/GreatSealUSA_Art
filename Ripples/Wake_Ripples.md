"Ah… so these are the kinds of things that irritate people. In addition – and this is I think, ah, the take on language that he has – basically words can always misrefer. They could always misrefer. Our meanings could always go astray. Even when we point – this is the most simple example analytic philosophers use – I can say “Get me that cup there”, and you could still pick up this one instead of this one. Pointing won’t even guarantee a reference. And if it’s possible to misrefer, if it’s possible to misread, if its possible to misunderstand, then it belongs to that structure I have called language to do those things. Because a possibility once is a necessity forever. Let me say that again. A possibility once – when we speak in structural terms – is a necessity forever. This is what makes original sin so interesting." - Rick Roderick, year 1993

Original sin is "The Fall of Mankind", Which the Founding Fathers of the USA did not assert or believe.  
Adam and Eve's disobedience in eating the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge

* On the Great Seal of the United States of America: "that is not the god of the Bible. These men did not believe in a Fall. They did not think the mind of man was cut off from God. The mind of man, cleansed of secondary and merely temporal concerns, beholds with the radiance of a cleansed mirror a reflection of the rational mind of God. Reason puts you in touch with God. Consequently, for these men, there is no special revelation anywhere" - The Power of Myth, published year 1988

# Not just any interpretation

"So don’t let “hermeneutics” throw you because it’s a big word; it means interpretation of texts. Now don’t think this is some “fancy Dan” academic exercise. A lot of people have died because they read a book the wrong way. I want you to think of the history of the world’s great religions. One could write a book called “The History of Heresies” and retitle it “The History of Misreadings That Led to Death”. Now I don’t mean to be cynical; it’s just obvious that reading a book and interpreting it a certain way can get you into a lot of trouble. Similarly, those familiar with the law know that just any reading of the constitution won’t work." - Rick Roderick, 1993
