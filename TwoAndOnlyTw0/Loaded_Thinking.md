The Loaded Question from the man in the comic to the women in the comic:

1. You deserved violence. Normalizing violence and hate. Avoiding The February 28, 1954 Equation.

2. Immigrants did it.

3. There is no third option, as bi-polar us vs. them mindset is thought-termining at two sides, both sides, "the other side" (of two sides). "Two sides to every story".

In this case, both choices are wrong. Side one is wrong, side two is wrong. The correct answer lies beyond the numbers one and two, beyond "both" sides of "an argument".

# The 1954 Equation

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

# Great Seal USA thinking

Non-instrumental reason thinking system.

George Lucas filmed lessons at Skywalker Ranch for the Star Wars audiences / Hollywood film fans in summer of 1986 and summer of 1987. This was the peak of George Lucas's society influence, popularituy, and he wanted audiences to understand how the monomyth sausages are made. So he filmed and hosted educational series for science fiction audiences.

Published in 1988 book "Power of Myth", page 37

"And so we are now on one side of **the pyramid**. We've moved from one to two. We are politically, historically, now a member of **one side of an argument**. We do not represent that principle of the eye up there. And all of our concerns have to do with economics and politics and not with the voice and sound of reason." - Joseph Campbell, age 83 in year 1987
