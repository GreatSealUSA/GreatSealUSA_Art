Hateful hostility if your intimate family doesn't go the way you want. Honor killings of parents / etc. How helen is behaving in first 3 episodes towards hive mind. The murder-suicide bomb in her house in Episode Three especially. Hellen (and much of the audience I have seen on Bluesky / Reddit / YouTube) deepest faith is sacracsm / satire. I didn't mean it. What if someone ACCIDENTLY confused the prop bomb from the real bomb? Loaded gun from unloaded gun? The FAITH in sarcasm exceeds the faith in taking a killing weapon seriously.

Now that the ending is out.    
Implosion / Explosion. Outer space, inner reaches. Airburst Spaceburst (EMP). Detonation / pre-detonation / pre-production / post-production hive mind arranging the fallout. Carols Fireworks and circle X marking spots. Mine as much New Mexico science lore into the fiction science lore. Church Stained Glass / parking lot glass bomb aftermath of Trinity site.

This GitHUb project name "\_Art" - Thou Art That book title https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_Art_That_(book) - Pluribus is Tough, We The People are *that* Pluribus. Art symbolism of the Founding Fathers 1776 language comprehension John One One. The Bible has no drawings of birds and arrows. It's all black and white words in modern print, stripped of the clergy hand-copied labors. "Before the printing press (mid-15th century), Christian clergy, primarily monks in monasteries, painstakingly hand-copied Bibles and other sacred texts onto parchment or vellum in scriptoria, a laborious process taking years per book, making them extremely rare, costly, and mostly accessible only to the Church, wealthy elites, or universities, with visual aids like stained glass telling stories to the largely illiterate populace."

Stolen love. Man in Vegas stealing love from hive mind.    
Stolen Helen by virus infection fall.    
Date Rape Drug that Carol uses at hospital on Pirate Lady in wheelchair (Kill Bill hospital bed pussy wagon exploits).       
Booze as *date-rape drug* Carol uses https://well.wvu.edu/educational-resources/alcohol-and-other-drug-programs/drinking-and-date-rape on Pirate Lady character. corrupting her character.    
Coercion with bomb in house, hand grenade, nuclear bomb, both delivered by the target of the love fiction.  
Stolen Eggs that Pirate Lady admits were pirated by the hive mind in Episode 9 at the Ski Lodge. Slipper slope (lesbian) metaphors abound. Vaginal canals and downhill morality races to the bottom of Moses's mountain / Mohammad's mountain Levant values of Goddess (Campbell 1988, Power of Myth on mountain vs. female god)    
Manic sex drive "episodes" Carol has.    
False labor, false "Southern Hospitality" of Deep South New Mexico stereotypes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_Southern_United_States Southern encroachment Texas bleedover I.C.E. hate of immigrants to New Mexico Mr. Walter *White*. teaching outcomes, white lab coats, Betty White Carol Fandom. Carol's indoctrination into White interment camp in deep rural woods of KKK culture at age 16 to beat the lesbian out of her by parents. Her parents sold her off to white slavers of sexual baby-making programming that got into her head. More than just sex with men, but white supremacy values in Carol from that age 16 kid-napping and torture camp. Period bleeding bleedover Texas and Camp Freedom. The double fleeing from ABQ the hive mind does (touch you with a 10 foot poll  / voting polling red state metaphors, red hot atomic bomb fallout on values of gun worship red state). Remember the Alamo against Mexico and *New* Mexico natives.    


Carol's custom crafted ABQ hood. the hood built by Walter White Saul television California Apple //+ computer empire apps empire song empire iTunes money. https://old.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1p2mtjw/the_set_in_the_middle_of_private_property_in_the/ - like she sells books, on Apple book store money. **Carol's hood** values of homestead, and wearing a KKK police car driving hood to defend her suburban oasis hood against *aliens* / immigrants. She drinks Vodka red gun loving hood KKK Russian drink... not Tequila Mexico in New Mexico dominates. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqQv3qef21A It's no fun being around Carol who bombs her guests and hugs the atomic bomb of Walter White science skills.

Reposado tequila, not that white stuff bland Russian Soviet drink Carol favors from the honey pot delivery / honey bear / lesbian partner bear.  The ABQ airport arrival to shave and clean "her bear". "Her bottom", her "bitch" tamed and domesticated alien. 

Yo, listen up, here is the story Kepler 22B B B B Blue world with oceans and Pale Blue Dot... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iwHb189X84 Pale Blue Dot "Blue are the feelings that live inside me" https://youtu.be/4iwHb189X84?t=104 - The "Most Miserable person on Pale Blue Dot - Carol" Sturka (escapee from the Twilight Zone family Sturka) - and of course, Avatar and the Blue Aliens science fiction trans-metaphor associations of life on other planets and military Carol in her police state car on Air Force One commanding USA nuclear weapon forces (Marines from Earth on Avatar blue peoples). Pirate Lady is an avatar sent to ABQ via special drop ship delivery / space ship delivery. 

"In the Apple TV+ series Pluribus, the main character Carol Sturka is portrayed by actress Rhea Seehorn, who has blue eyes." - White KKK more, blonde haired blue eye.

# Thick as Brick

Ok, the people who won't engage Campbell's 1988 book / Star Wars fandom / Science Fiction fandom book that Lucas wanted audiences to know and grasp about metaphors... people who are shallow and superficial MAGA December 2025 USA values (February 15, 2025: Social media cesspool - WGA presentation) ...

For the intermediate all 9 episodes at once fast-forward second-screen behaviors and mindsets....

Thick as a brick both parts, make a complete audience copypasta that ties to dialog / scenes / interpretations? Tim being a brick-layer as core Minute 22 Helen's post doc. "I hope you sit this one out, post-doc Helen at the Zero Hour in a Public House discussing James Joyce. Your clergy are thick as a brick"  
Sold to society.. sold to advertising for Free Social media Reddit / Twitter / D.O.G.E. musk / sold-out Pluribus Latin "We The People" ideals of nation hive mind proposal, sold out to Russia 

https://youtu.be/GTWQv8RsI6s?t=62 part 2: Disease of alien invasion, Carol's child egg basket taken from her: "with the discovery of his disease... We'll take the child from him, put it to the test" (lab testing lab rats opening Episode One, "WE will take", Pluribus will take, "We is Us" lab rat episode name of pilot).

# Episode 9 Title from Top

From the top with the Title (not released until a week before, confirm?)...

*La Chica* or ...      

https://youtu.be/GTWQv8RsI6s?t=62 Part 2: Disease of alien invasion, Carol's child egg basket taken from her: **"with the discovery of his disease... We'll take the child from him, put it to the test"** (stem cells, lab testing white lab rats opening Episode One, "WE will take", Pluribus will take, "We is Us" take child from free independent Carol). Egg piracy.

... *huevo (or huevos) can be used vulgarly for "testicles" or in phrases like "¡A huevo!" meaning "Definitely!" or "¿Qué huevo?" meaning "What a drag!"*

The Chicks or their Eggs. **Alien abduction** / stem cell **alien probing** of Carol's genetic children / family tree (stem cells, stems from) of the Apple tree in Eden / Apple TV audience / Steve Jobs legacy. The pair of Stephen trees in the Garden of Eden - and seeds inside those apples. The pretender, alien invader, who took over Eden and planted that one trouble tree of knowledge devices / computing information systems.

https://youtu.be/GTWQv8RsI6s?t=521 The Creation of Kings, King of Kings Christmas Story Eve Day Episode 9, has begun! In the Re-Beginning. Revelation 19:16 - the King Elvis on Air Force One with the Nuclear Football (brain damaging football / Tim + Helen ladder falls) who went to West Gate Elvis Suite.

https://youtu.be/GTWQv8RsI6s?t=972 The hive mind helped Carol pick up Helen dead, your dead... out of her stolen (police state take over by Carol the police) truck... but she demanded they stop. They helped air-lift equipment to dig a hole for Helen. Taking out the dead. Join your voices in the Hellish Chorus. Carol Christmas ending.

# Joyce wordplay, Egg Piracy

Expired eggs. Menopause ladies. Frozen for safe keeping beyond the expiration date of the egg maker. 

Egg piracy sounds like ex expire date, dating, courting Pirate Lady, she stole my egg basket. On and on.

&nbsp;

# Choice marriage

A lot could be mapped out in metaphors of a goodness choice marriage

1. Moving from bed to couch. Carol has been sleeping on the couch and symbolic return to marriage bed in season one.

2. The hive mind moves out of ABQ but does NOT block store and forward messaging (email / Twitter / Facebook / voice mail). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_and_forward

3. Martin Luther in Germany on Halloween used store and forward messaging delivery, cork board, tree, BBS system metaphors. He was a man of the clergy, knew how to speak, but changed communications channels

4. The virus is spread peer to peer kissing at the vending machine, marriage 1st base progression metaphors. Kiss and tell, immediate dialog, intercourse dialog metaphors. That is blocked by the hive mind moving to ABQ. Also going to air delivery of the virus on the Zero Hour.

5. Leaving books and script notes behind to your lover. Helen to Carol, and the constriction of Pirate Lady incarnate as a script note to the author.

6. Moving into a hotel room / when violence. Carol put the immigrant man in the ambulance over to the guest house.

7. MLK Jr on *the system* but not defeating *the person*. How the hive mind changes systems by moving out, but does not unlove Carol or prevent her from communicating.

8. MLK Jr on liking a person vs. love and the choice to love not being a choice at all in the long run. OPERA_A The Eagles Long Run
