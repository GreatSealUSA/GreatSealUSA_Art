Hateful hostility if your intimate family doesn't go the way you want. Honor killings of parents / etc. How helen is behaving in first 3 episodes towards hive mind. The murder-suicide bomb in her house in Episode Three especially. Hellen (and much of the audience I have seen on Bluesky / Reddit / YouTube) deepest faith is sacracsm / satire. I didn't mean it. What if someone ACCIDENTLY confused the prop bomb from the real bomb? Loaded gun from unloaded gun? The FAITH in sarcasm exceeds the faith in taking a killing weapon seriously.

This GitHUb project name "\_Art" - Thou Art That book title https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_Art_That_(book) - Pluribus is Tough, We The People are *that* Pluribus. Art symbolism of the Founding Fathers 1776 language comprehension John One One. The Bible has no drawings of birds and arrows. It's all black and white words in modern print, stripped of the clergy hand-copied labors. "Before the printing press (mid-15th century), Christian clergy, primarily monks in monasteries, painstakingly hand-copied Bibles and other sacred texts onto parchment or vellum in scriptoria, a laborious process taking years per book, making them extremely rare, costly, and mostly accessible only to the Church, wealthy elites, or universities, with visual aids like stained glass telling stories to the largely illiterate populace."

Stolen love. Man in Vegas stealing love from hive mind.    
Stolen Helen by virus infection fall.    
Date Rape Drug that Carol uses at hospital on Pirate Lady in wheelchair (Kill Bill hospital bed pussy wagon exploits).       
Booze as *date-rape drug* Carol uses https://well.wvu.edu/educational-resources/alcohol-and-other-drug-programs/drinking-and-date-rape on Pirate Lady character. corrupting her character.    
Coercion with bomb in house, hand grenade, nuclear bomb, both delivered by the target of the love fiction.  
Stolen Eggs that Pirate Lady admits were pirated by the hive mind in Episode 9 at the Ski Lodge. Slipper slope (lesbian) metaphors abound. Vaginal canals and downhill morality races to the bottom of Moses's mountain / Mohammad's mountain Levant values of Goddess (Campbell 1988, Power of Myth on mountain vs. female god)    
Manic sex drive "episodes" Carol has.    
False labor, false "Southern Hospitality" of Deep South New Mexico stereotypes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_Southern_United_States Southern encroachment Texas bleedover I.C.E. hate of immigrants to New Mexico Mr. Walter *White*. teaching outcomes, white lab coats, Betty White Carol Fandom. Carol's indoctrination into White interment camp in deep rural woods of KKK culture at age 16 to beat the lesbian out of her by parents. Her parents sold her off to white slavers of sexual baby-making programming that got into her head. More than just sex with men, but white supremacy values in Carol from that age 16 kid-napping and torture camp. Period bleeding bleedover Texas and Camp Freedom. The double fleeing from ABQ the hive mind does (touch you with a 10 foot poll  / voting polling red state metaphors, red hot atomic bomb fallout on values of gun worship red state).
