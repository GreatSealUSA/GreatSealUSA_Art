# Two and Only Two

Two Plus Two = Two And Only Two    
Pretzel Logic of math counting that when you have two wrong answers, you did everything you could, that both sides are all you need to cover.

I don't just mean political parties, I mean news organizations, I mean everything where people flip a coin to choose which wrong answer to select. Instead of counting to 12, climbing up the Great Seal USA pyramid steps to 12, and leaping into the baker's dozen answer.

Am I making myself clear here on GitHub?   
Inside the box thinking, that if presented two choices, both can be terrible when better thinking is outside those choice boxes of mindset framing.
