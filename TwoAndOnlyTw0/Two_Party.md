# Two and Only Two

Two Plus Two = Two And Only Two    
Pretzel Logic of math counting that when you have two wrong answers, you did everything you could, that both sides are all you need.

I don't just mean political parties, I mean news organizations, I mean everything whre people flip a coin to choose which wrong answer to select. Instead of counting to 12, climaing up the Great Seal USA pyramid steps to 12, and leaping into the baker's dozen answer.

Am I making myself clear here on GitHub?
