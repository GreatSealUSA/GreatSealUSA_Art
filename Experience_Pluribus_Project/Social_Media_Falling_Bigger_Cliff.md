ToDo:

Art to Art Great Seal Metaphors of Artistic Translations:

1. Breaking Bad / Vince Gilligan stressful scenes of Air Traffic Controller daddy issues

2. The Simpsons Y2K overflow of 1999.999999999 to 2000.0000000000000 rollover video game high score machine crashes.

3. Falling from Step 13 of Great Seal of the United States of America pyramid to Step 0 / ground and slightly below ground. Founding Fathers metaphors of Tim Finnegan's ladder. (Finnegan's Wake song was originated in USA printing; American Experiences)

1. Experience Pluribus: On paper, running out of printer ink, [Gutenberg Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gutenberg_Galaxy) metaphors.   
"We did it to ourselves"

Even when labeled... Nobody reads, attraction to images exceeds literacy

1. Neil Postman on drowning in information / nobody reading. "What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business

The Titanic One, ass-backwards     
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=1083      

1. Bit-flipping metaphors, ass-backwards Titanic problems of literacy / teaching / education / training students.

2. MonoMyth mythological storytelling opcode inversions

3. Large Language Models / Generative Artificial Intelligence has the same problem Joseph Campbell (Experience Mythology educator from Sarah Lawrence College) describes of Levant monomyth modern adaptations / readings. https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/

4. Odd Funny Amusing mind exploit, the out-group mocking of Levant John One One generative science fiction trilogy fandom warfare, The Crusades of of inverted storytelling ( Romans 11:32 being the largest inversion of all identified by James Joyce / Levant 13 origins 2,000 years ago. "1 John 4:20" a close second on fiction character vs. nonfiction hate of living persons )

&nbsp;

Titanic anchored on MonoMyth, 12 feet tall (almost 13 Great Seal experience)    
Perspective all wrong on story interpretations of Gigantic Titanic    
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=1144    

1. This is what we are teaching and feeding our children. Inverted tiny Gigantic Titanic paradox patterns of a real ship that sailed on the Atlantic real ocean. Ad Reel / Real filming behind the scenes bullshit.

2. "12 feet tall", can't skip the MonoMyth call-out by one of the greatest MonoMyth Reformation Bloggers of all humankind! John One One rewriter with her pen in hand! “Once I had asked God for [one or two extra inches in height](https://youtu.be/I0fGxujeJbY?t=224), but instead he made me as tall as the sky, so high that **I could not measure myself**.” ― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. October 8, 2013 - the Punk January 2009 blogger to the Godfathers of John 1:1 Tower of Babel Levant from afar in Swat Valley, Pakistan. Don't it show?

Errors compounding, like a virus, error cascade, recursive errors.     
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=1152     

1. Rick Roderick 1993 on Xerox copies of copies degrade.

2. The redundancy in books that McLuhan noted, skipping every other page with his hands covering them. But that redundancy teaches human mind to expand perspective with word choice variations / variable comprehension like Joyce writes.

The Shit that Rises to the Top      
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=1254    

1. Metaphors of leaders and leading indicators and leadership signals of "shit". Social Media machines / Media networks and machine technology leading us.

2. Neil Postman (in Manhattan shadow of Statue of Liberty, Carol Lady Liberty Torches of Freedom Minute 22 Exit from the Public House to smoke metaphors), 1992: “Technopoly is a state of culture. It is also a state of mind. It consists in the deification of technology, which means that the culture seeks its authorization in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and **takes its orders from technology**.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The **Surrender of Culture** to Technology - to A.I. shit floating.
