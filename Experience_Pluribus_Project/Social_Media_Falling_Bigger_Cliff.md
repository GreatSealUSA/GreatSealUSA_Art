Art to Art Great Seal Metaphors of Artistic Translations:

1. Breaking Bad / Vince Gilligan stressful scenes of Air Traffic Controller daddy issues

2. The Simpsons Y2K overflow of 1999.999999999 to 2000.0000000000000 rollover video game high score machine crashes.

3. Falling from Step 13 of Great Seal of the United States of America pyramid to Step 0 / ground and slightly below ground. Founding Fathers metaphors of Tim Finnegan's ladder. (Finnegan's Wake song was originated in USA printing; American Experiences)

1. Experience Pluribus: On paper, running out of printer ink, [Gutenberg Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gutenberg_Galaxy) metaphors.   
"We did it to ourselves"

&nbsp;

Even when labeled... Nobody reads, attraction to images exceeds literacy     
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=1075    

1. Neil Postman on drowning in information / nobody reading. "What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business


&nbsp;

The Titanic One, ass-backwards     
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=1083      

1. Bit-flipping metaphors, ass-backwards Titanic problems of literacy / teaching / education / training students.

2. MonoMyth mythological storytelling opcode inversions

3. Large Language Models / Generative Artificial Intelligence has the same problem Joseph Campbell (Experience Mythology educator from Sarah Lawrence College) describes of Levant monomyth modern adaptations / readings. https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/

4. Odd Funny Amusing mind exploit, the out-group mocking of Levant John One One generative science fiction trilogy fandom warfare, The Crusades of of inverted storytelling ( Romans 11:32 being the largest inversion of all identified by James Joyce / Levant 13 origins 2,000 years ago. "1 John 4:20" a close second on fiction character vs. nonfiction hate of living persons )

&nbsp;

Titanic anchored on MonoMyth, 12 feet tall (almost 13 Great Seal experience)    
Perspective all wrong on story interpretations of Gigantic Titanic    
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=1144    

1. This is what we are teaching and feeding our children. Inverted tiny Gigantic Titanic paradox patterns of a real ship that sailed on the Atlantic real ocean. Ad Reel / Real filming behind the scenes bullshit.

2. "12 feet tall", can't skip the MonoMyth call-out by one of the greatest MonoMyth Reformation Bloggers of all humankind! John One One rewriter with her pen in hand! “Once I had asked God for [one or two extra inches in height](https://youtu.be/I0fGxujeJbY?t=224), but instead he made me as tall as the sky, so high that **I could not measure myself**.” ― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. October 8, 2013 - the Punk January 2009 blogger to the Godfathers of John 1:1 Tower of Babel Levant from afar in Swat Valley, Pakistan. Don't it show?

&nbsp;

Errors compounding, like a virus, error cascade, recursive errors.     
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=1152     

1. Rick Roderick 1993 on Xerox copies of copies degrade.

2. The redundancy in books that McLuhan noted, skipping every other page with his hands covering them. But that redundancy teaches human mind to expand perspective with word choice variations / variable comprehension like Joyce writes.

&nbsp;

The Shit that Rises to the Top      
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=1254    

1. Metaphors of leaders and leading indicators and leadership signals of "shit". Social Media machines / Media networks and machine technology leading us.

2. Neil Postman (in Manhattan shadow of Statue of Liberty, Carol Lady Liberty Torches of Freedom Minute 22 Exit from the Public House to smoke metaphors), 1992: “Technopoly is a state of culture. It is also a state of mind. It consists in the deification of technology, which means that the culture seeks its authorization in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and **takes its orders from technology**.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The **Surrender of Culture** to Technology - to A.I. shit floating.

&nbsp;

Glitches are Funny, Surkovian media glitch leadership       
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=1679     

1. Glitches attract amused joke audience. Attraction to glitch mockery.

2. Neil Postman 1985... again and again... iterations

3. Surkov governing based on glitching politicians and [glitching RT media empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surkov_leaks). Butterfly glitching metaphors. "I try to protest—but they just smile and pity me. To believe in something and stand by it in this world is derided, the ability to be a shape-shifter celebrated. Vladimir Nabokov once described a species of butterfly that at an early stage in its development had to learn how to change colors to hide from predators. The butterfly’s predators had long died off, but still it changed its colors from the sheer pleasure of transformation. Something similar has happened to the Russian elites" - year 2014

4. "Fake News" Finn Cycle. pre World War One build-up. Year 1848 Germany breeding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lying_press

5. Glitching Out, far-out mind exploits. Deep inceptions. The stars above the eagle's head on the Great Seal of the USA runaway monomyth science fiction, dark art defenses.

6. Glitch art. Pete Townshend [smashing[(https://youtu.be/H_r_dWenKhk?t=175) guitar / distortion.

Heart of the Matter: Economics    
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=1958    

1. NO, no no no no no no. This is "Follow the Money" logic All The President's Men 1976 (USA 200) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QodGxD19_as that GOT US HERE in 2025.

2. NO, no no no no no no. This is "Show me the Money" logic that got us here. Jerry Mc Programming of the mass man to bow to the sports team owners (Bellevue, Washington NFL purchase team I was upon) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpwSXWq1wwU that got We The People (Pluribus Us) here with shallow admiration of Walter White fiction characters.

3. NO, no no no no no. Suppressed Mythology education! "The **economic interpretation of history is for the birds. Economics is itself a function of aspiration**. It's what people aspire to that creates the field in which economics works. And people who don't have any aspirations—you know, the problem of a businessman who can't get people to want anything. It's the want; it's the aspiration. And what is wanted is not simply one, two or three meals a day and a bed—that's not enough. It's got to be much more than that to make a life." - Cooper Union. March 1, 1967. Joseph Campbell

Jay: spend your day doing work you don't like to have time outside work     
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=2611      

1. Rick Roderick 1993 "On the other hand, I don’t want it to not be funny, because part of the **postmodern trajectory itself is a rather humorous joke on the human race** which laboured for millennia to reduce working hours in order to produce leisure so we could enjoy this very leisure that then turns in a kind of **vengeful act against us absorbing our leisure time**, which was to be our living time, into time now spent in the service of what can only be called this inhuman spectacle. I mean, it’s a very bizarre and twisted fate to which postmodernity has led us. So I would be wary of simple answers to this." - https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

&nbsp;

Mike's Favorite: Tim Finnegan year 1923 Funeral Wake ritual metaphors      
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=2687      

1. Where to begin on the McLuhan media ecology coffin teachings of Joyce. OPERA_A A.I. killed the YouTube star https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx5tSmOY_iM 1,980,170 views June 23, 2010 (Lyrics highly recommended about not being able to rewind media ecology and drum machines not having "spirit", and [Sister Disco]()https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTTY6Z51mO0 from The Who)

2. Puppeting Barking Bob antics metaphors abound. OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7km4EHgkQiw Sting, it hurts. 1993 Rick Roderick lectures... same year as song. "You could say I'd lost my belief in our politicians... They all seemed like **game show hosts** to me! If I ever lose my faith in you: There'd be nothing left for me to do" - some would say I was a lost man on GitHub

&nbsp;

Jay goes on about "lazy", very much Marshall McLuhan concern     
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=2815     

1. "LSD is the Lazy Man's Finnegans Wake" book (1923 Finn's Hotel to Star Wars May Force Day 1939) by Joyce. University of Toronto's on drug use LSD lazy vs. reading a book with "The Force" language. https://youtube.com/watch?v=-f2F02gsYsk

### RLM 2986

War of All against All: War against Reality tricking     
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=2986      

1. Peer to peer war, peer to peer terror / terrorism. https://old.reddit.com/r/WarAll/comments/1msqs1t/war_of_all_against_all_since_march_2013_war/ "would go on to call the Fifth World War. The first nonlinear war of all against all. Which is a description by Vladislav Surkov, who sort of the ennui ??? of Russian politics, of the current (year 2014) war around Ukraine. um, so, I started working in Russian TV" ... ... ... source for video clip: https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxGLMkhbMgSwzWeQK7xYIBJ-nxn_UlzOdZ Video was published December 5, 2014

&nbsp;

Jay's assertion of real vs. unreal      
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=3049

1. Rick Roderick 1993 "The **war zone**, in other words, may not be – in defending the self – may not be any of the classical ones. Like the working class versus the ruling class, the slaves against the masters, oppressed women against, ah, patriarchal society, blacks against whites. No, **the struggle in the future may be to maintain the real against the unreal or the hyperreal or the irreal**." - https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

2. I think mockery-quotations, where people are projecting words into a situation, need new Unicode quotation marks. I also think a filename character Unicode marker of fiction vs. nonfiction. These are all the concerns of 1923 Finn's Hotel.

3. Regarding The Great Seal of the United States / Constitution. Separation of fiction from nonfiction. Church monomyth science fiction storytelling vs. factual source validated information. King James Bible vs *supernatural removed* [Thomas Jefferson Bible year 1820](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Bible) Deism edited. Surkov governing is fiction-based leadership. A marker of all media having fiction vs. nonfiction marker. The Fox News "entertainment" and Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" comedy fiction of Surkov techniques. **September 9, 2014 - the war underway already began being described**. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

&nbsp;

### RLM 3334 

Conclusion: Predictions     
https://youtu.be/IPitD1eYLiM?t=3334      

Mike's final words: The Tricking is where it will go bad.

1. The very Red Letter media being discussed had A.I. clips from other creators in it, like the Bob Barker. So their watermark idea would cover the entire video. DVD and other formats already have chapters, it needs to be down to page or chapter level - or frame marker / word marker like Bible verse sentence markers (Finnegans Wake readers use page and within page markers). GitHub word of each commit proving source material.

2. Tricking a nation of suckers with billionaires from anywhere on World Wide Web having technology systems behind closed datacenter doors that the public can't tell if real or hand-tweaked. ... ... ... "Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of confusion and bamboozle requires vigilance, dedication and courage. But if we don’t practice these tough habits of thought, we cannot hope to solve the truly serious problems that face us and we risk becoming a nation of suckers" ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 38
