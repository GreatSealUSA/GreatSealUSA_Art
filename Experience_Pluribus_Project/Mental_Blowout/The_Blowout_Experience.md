# The Blowout Experience

* "Breaking new ground, whether it is something like a technological breakthrough or simply a way of living that is not what the community can help you with, there’s always the danger of too much enthusiasm, of neglecting certain mechanical details. Then you fall off." - Age 83, published year 1988

* "So I am trying to understand it and think about it as much as I can, and a sense you get is one that resembles vertigo. How many of you have seen Vertigo, the great Alfred Hitchcock movie? You know, that sort of sickly sense that you are twisting above… sort of, abysmally too much of something. This seems to me a fine, sort of, mood characterisation for the postmodern trajectory. A sense of vertigo before all this information." - Year 1993 https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/
