# The Blowout Experience

* "Breaking new ground, whether it is something like a technological breakthrough or simply a way of living that is not what the community can help you with, there’s always the danger of too much enthusiasm, of neglecting certain mechanical details.

"The fanatic actually, however, is a rather raw type. He is not seasoned in the field. He is like a convert to a new religion.

And it doesn’t take much of an idea to blow some people." - Year 1974, Lecture I.1.5 - The Vitality of Myth

We understood information overload in year 1974, but we do not in any way shape or form in year 2026! A complete loss of hand-me-down experience of having billionaires blow out citizen minds!
