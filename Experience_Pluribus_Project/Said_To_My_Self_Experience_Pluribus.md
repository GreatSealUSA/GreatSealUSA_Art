* Lyrics: "I couldn't retrieve it! Said to myself: *What's it All about?*"

Who would Believe it, With a WORD Pluribus, you dry We The People's tears!

You know... The Tree of Knowledge, you can put out the fire!    
You, We, Us, All of Us, Pluribus can work together to put out the Runaway Russian information warfare fires!    

* "The second is a cosmological dimension, the dimension with which science is concerned — showing you what the shape of the universe is, but **showing it in such a way** that the mystery again comes through. Today we tend to think that scientists have all the answers. But the great ones tell us, “No, we haven’t got all the answers. We’re telling you how it works — but what is it?” You strike a match, **what’s fire**? You can tell me about oxidation, but that doesn’t tell me a thing."
