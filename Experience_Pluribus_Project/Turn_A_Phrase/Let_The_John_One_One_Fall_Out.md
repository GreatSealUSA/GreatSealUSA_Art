# Let The John  1:1 *Fall* Out 

We *The People* are the origins of John 1:1 Bible verse    
Everyone has been there   
Fallen for the Fear, The Fall    
Bow down to the John 1:1 Mighty!  

Maybe there is a way out!

YOU Can TURN A PHRASE, YOU CAN **TURN John 1:1 Bible** verse!    
You can start Speaking Up!

**THEN SPEAK***    

"So what I suddenly realized when I ***recognized that in the Great Seal of the United States*** there were two of these symbolic  triangles interlocked was that we now had thirteen points, for our thirteen original states, and that there were now, furthermore, no less than six apexes, one above, one below, and four (so to say) to the four quarters. The sense of this, it seemed to me, might be that from above or below, or from any point of the compass, the creative Word might be heard, which is the great thesis of democracy. Democracy assumes that anybody from any quarter can speak, and speak truth, because his mind is not cut off from the truth. All he has to do is clear out his passions **and then speak**." - Year 1988 published book. Age 83 teacher.

Maybe there is a way out of the cage where you live! Maybe one of these days...
