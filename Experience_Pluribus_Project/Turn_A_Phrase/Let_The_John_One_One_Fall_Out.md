# Let The John  1:1 *Fall* Out 

We *The People* are the origins of John 1:1 Bible verse    
Everyone has been there   
Fallen for the Fear, The Fall    
Bow down to the John 1:1 Mighty!  

Maybe there is a way out!

YOU Can TURN A PHRASE, YOU CAN **TURN John 1:1 Bible** verse!    
You can start Speaking Up!

**THEN SPEAK***    

"So what I suddenly realized when I ***recognized that in the Great Seal of the United States*** there were two of these symbolic  triangles interlocked was that we now had thirteen points, for our thirteen original states, and that there were now, furthermore, no less than six apexes, one above, one below, and four (so to say) to the four quarters. The sense of this, it seemed to me, might be that from above or below, or from any point of the compass, the creative Word might be heard, which is the great thesis of democracy. Democracy assumes that anybody from any quarter can speak, and speak truth, because his mind is not cut off from the truth. All he has to do is clear out his passions **and then speak**." - Year 1988 published book. Age 83 teacher.

Maybe there is a way out of the cage where you live! Maybe one of these days...

... The Pluribus Experiences We All, All of Us, Pluribus ....

# The Fallen, The Outcast 

We All Are! 

"You can be amazing! You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug... You can be the outcast!"

* "We’ve inherited the circle with the four cardinal points and three hundred and sixty degrees. The official Sumerian year was three hundred and sixty days with five holy days that don’t count, which are outside of time and in which **they had ceremonies relating their society to the heavens. Now we’re losing this sense of the circle in relation to time**, because we have digital time, where you just have time buzzing by. Out of the digital you get the sense of the flow of time. At Penn Station in New York, there’s a clock with the hours, the minutes, the seconds, the tenths of seconds, and the hundredths of seconds. When you see the hundredths of a second buzzing by, you realize how time is running through you.
The circle, on the other hand, represents totality. Everything within the circle is one thing, which is encircled, enframed. That would be the spatial aspect. But the temporal aspect of the circle is that you leave, go somewhere, and always come back. God is the alpha and the omega, the source and the end. The circle suggests immediately a completed totality, whether in time or in space."
