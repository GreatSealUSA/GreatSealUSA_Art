# Pluribus: Dollar Bill Handshake Experience 

&nbsp;

The association could be made with the industrial revolution of humanity. And how two world wars tried to spread technology of a mechanized hardware and process system across the planet.

A less mechanized industrial software (softer) approach would be to win hearts and minds with a book tour, publishing your hive mind. Perhaps on a small flyer of paper that people trade with the word "Pluribus" in Latin on it. To convince people through peaceful exchange of an idea on paper traded all over the planet. A global charm campaign. Novus ordo seclorum
