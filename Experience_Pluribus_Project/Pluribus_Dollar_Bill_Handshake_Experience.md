# Pluribus: Dollar Bill Handshake Experience 

&nbsp;

The association could be made with the industrial revolution of humanity. And how two world wars tried to spread technology of a mechanized hardware and process system across the planet.

A less mechanized industrial software (softer) approach would be to win hearts and minds with a book tour, publishing your hive mind. Perhaps on a small flyer of paper that people trade with the word "Pluribus" in Latin on it. To convince people through peaceful exchange of an idea on paper traded all over the planet. A global charm campaign. Novus ordo seclorum

# After witnessing One World War

There was an attempt to revive Plurbus metaphors after falls to World War One mechanized chemical warfare. A year 1923 Finn's Hotel morning wake up! calling.

After witnessing One Global Virus   

A pandemic peer to peer, with Spanish conquest the origin of metaphors, but life on Earth itself doing the programming. Not some Eden origins, but past hand-*we*-down leafs of knowledge and RNA / DNA / immune system challenges that span the shipping lanes of the old pirates.

* "The mystery has been reduced to a set of concepts and ideas, and emphasizing these concepts and ideas can short-circuit the transcendent, connoted experience. An intense experience of mystery is what one has to regard as the ultimate religious experience.
