There are days when I wake up with a feeling    
That the world is a strange and sunless place     
It's a world where words have lost their sense     
Where nothin' seems to fit      
And then suddenly I'll see her face    
In a dream, I will drive along the ocean    
At the end of a dark familiar ride
