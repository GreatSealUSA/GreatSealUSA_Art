There are days when I wake up with a feeling    
That the world is a strange and sunless place     
It's a world where words have lost their sense     
Where nothin' seems to fit      
And then suddenly I'll see her face    
In a dream, I will drive along the ocean    
At the end of a dark familiar ride

Words have lost their sense, society-wide mass man (Marshall McLuhan, University of Toronto) connections. Egoism and anti-Pluribus greed dragging down (Skywalking raches, "Power of Myth", 1988; "And of course what destroys reason is passion. The principal passion in politics is greed. That is what pulls you down. And that's why we're on this side instead of the top of the pyramid.").

* "You’re a corpse. And you prove that every day, with everything you do and everything you say. Wake up, ya dope! Outside” ― Donald Fagen, Eminent Hipsters, year 2013
