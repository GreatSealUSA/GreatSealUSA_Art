* "This is a scholarly attempt to reconstruct **an order of initiation that would result in spiritual revelation**. These founding fathers who were Masons actually studied what they could of Egyptian lore. In Egypt, the pyramid represents the primordial hillock. After the annual flood of the Nile begins to sink down, the first hillock is symbolic of the reborn world. That's what this seal represents." - Luke Skywalking Gauchos teaching lessons, Summer of 1985 / 1986 / 1987 - filmed by George Lucas for Star Wars fandoms and Pale Blue Dot hill climbers of the worlds
