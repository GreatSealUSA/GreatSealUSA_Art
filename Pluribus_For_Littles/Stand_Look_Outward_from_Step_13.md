* "this **new world** has been built in the sense of God's original creation, and the reflection of God's original creation, through reason, has brought this about. If you look behind that pyramid, you see a desert. **If you look before it, you see plants** growing." - Summer of 1986 lessons for Luke Skywalker audiences in California
