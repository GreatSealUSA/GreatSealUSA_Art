Lyrics: "It can happen to *everyone* eventually" - We The People Pluribus.      
Lyrics: "Developing words that linger. Through **fields of green, through open eyes**. This for us to see." - On the Nile river on the front-facing side of the pyramid. OPERA_A https://youtu.be/OeVgcIFEh3I?t=145

* "this **new world** has been built in the sense of God's original creation, and the reflection of God's original creation, through reason, has brought this about. If you look behind that pyramid, you see a desert. **If you look before it, you see plants** growing." - Summer of 1986 lessons for Luke Skywalker audiences in California

* Development of Words (John 1:1) that linger, the Tower of Babel metaphors abound. The Constitution, Deceleration of Independence, developing the Bill of Rights. ... "This is a triangle composed of ten points, one point in the middle and four points to each side, adding up to nine: one, two, three, four/five, **six, seven**/eight, nine. This is the primary symbol of Pythagorean philosophy, susceptible of a number of **interrelated** mythological, cosmological, psychological, and sociological interpretations, one of which is the dot at the apex as **representing the creative center out of which the universe and all things** have come." - Summer of 1985 Skywalking Lessons for Star Wars fandom in California for Hollywood audiences and creators.

Lyrics: "Trees would be Falling" - Trees of Knowledge and Trees in Eden. "That was out entirely. And that's why they rejected the idea of the Fall, too. All men are competent to know the mind of God. There is no revelation special to any people." -  Summer of 1987 lessons for Luke Skywalking audiences with California Gauchos OPERA_A https://youtu.be/bLaSXpqp__E?t=70
