* Amazing Journey 1969 Lyrics: **"EACH NOTE MAKES"** .... ["a key to understanding numbers, music (ratios 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 4:3), and the cosmos (Musica Universalis), embodying the divine unfolding from Unity (1) to the whole (10)."](/%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%84%CF%8D%CF%82/Monument_Of_Africa_USA_Ubuntu.md)

Lyrics: Ten Years Old, Thoughts as Bold as Thoughts Can Be, The Great Seal interpretations at Age 10, Dollar Bill! "the divine unfolding from Unity (1) to the whole (10)" triangles, angels of Trinity.

Lyrics "Down to the Ground" https://youtu.be/F9Ik-9CrXgE?t=105   

* "When you're **down on the lower levels of this pyramid**, you will be either on one side or on the other. But when you get up to the top" - Skywalker Ranch lessons for Star Wars Fans, Summer of 1986, California (1:42 "silver glittering cloud and the golden" 1:45 "falls down to the ground")

ToDo: Golden top was originally on Egypt pyramids? electrum? (Electronic Daft Punk / The Who Punk metaphors ToDo too)  Are these original lyrics by USA military adaptation? "He's dressed in a silver-sparked
Glittering gown And his golden beard flows Nearly down to the ground" - in the USA military I hear "falls" (Fall of Mankind, Eden) more than "flows) and YouTube Transcript agrees. I don't hear the word "nearly" in USA military?
